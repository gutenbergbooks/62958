<p>MEDICINAL DYNAMETER<br /><em>AND<br />SCALE <span class='fss'>OF</span> EQUIVALENTS</em>.<br /><br /><em>Engraved for the Second American Edition of Paris’s Pharmacologia.</em><br /><br />EXPLANATION.<br /><br /><em>This Instrument will shew on bare inspection, the quantity of active matter contained in any given weight or measure  (according as it is solid or liquid) of any Officinal compound, and the dose of any preparation which will be equivalent in strength to any given quantity of any other of the same class. The active principles, or Medicinal Bases, are distinguished by capital letters, placed in coloured squares; and each Officinal Preparation is marked by a line corresponding in colour with that of its active ingredient. If we require the quantity of active matter in any given dose of an Officinal Preparation, we have only to bring such preparation to the number in question and the figure opposite the active ingredient answers the question, while those opposite to the other compounds of the same class denote the equivalent quantities. Unless otherwise expressed, the figures denote Grains for the solids, and Minim for the liquids.</em></p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The Public are already in possession of many pharmaceutical compendiums
and epitomes of plausible pretensions, composed with the view of
directing the practice of the junior, and of relieving the occasional embarrassments
of the more experienced practitioner. Nothing is farther from
my intention than to disparage their several merits, or to question their
claims to professional utility; but in truth and justice it must be confessed
that, as far as these works relate to the art of composing scientific prescriptions,
their authors have not escaped the too common error of supposing
that the reader is already grounded in the first principles of the science;
or, to borrow the figurative illustration of a popular writer, <em>that while they
are in the ship of science, they forget the disciple cannot arrive without a boat</em>.
I am not acquainted with any book that is calculated to furnish such assistance,
or which professes to teach the <span class='sc'>Grammar</span>, and ground-work of
this important branch of medical knowledge. Numerous are the works
which present us with the detail, but no one with the philosophy of the
subject. We have copious catalogues of formal recipes, and many of unexceptionable
propriety, but the compilers do not venture to discuss the
principles upon which they were constructed, nor do they explain the part
which each ingredient is supposed to perform in the general scheme of the
formula; they cannot therefore lead to any useful generalization, and the
young practitioner, without a beacon that can direct his course in safety, is
abandoned to the alternative of two great evils—a feeble and servile routine,
on one hand, or a wild and lawless empiricism, on the other. The
present volume is an attempt to supply this deficiency: and while I am
anxious to ‘catch the ideas which lead from ignorance to knowledge,’ it
is not without hope that I may also be able to suggest the means by
which our already acquired knowledge may be more widely and usefully
extended; and, by offering a collective and arranged view of the objects
and resources of medicinal combination, to establish its practice upon the
basis of science, and thereby to render its future career of improvement
progressive with that of the other branches of medicine; or, to follow up
the figurative illustration already introduced, <em>to furnish a boat, which may
not only convey the disciple to the ship, but which may also assist in piloting the
ship herself from her shallow and treacherous moorings</em>. That the design
however of the present work may not be mistaken, it is essential to remark
that it is elementary only in reference to the art of prescribing, for it is presumed
that the student is already acquainted with the common manipulations
of pharmacy, and with the first principles of chemistry. When any
allusions are made to the processes of the Pharmacopœia, they are to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>understood as being only supplementary, or as explanatory of their nature,
in reference to the application or medicinal powers of the substance in question.
The term <span class='sc'>Pharmacologia</span>, as applied to the present work, may
therefore be considered as contradistinctive to that of <span class='sc'>Pharmacopœia</span>;
for while the latter denotes the processes for <em>preparing</em>, the former comprehends
the scientific methods of <em>administering</em> medicinal bodies, and explains
the objects and theory of their operation. The articles of the Materia
Medica have been arranged in alphabetical order, not only as being that
best calculated for reference, but one which, in an elementary work at
least, is less likely to mislead, than any arrangement founded on their
medicinal powers; for in consequence of the difficulty of discriminating in
every case between the primary and secondary effects of a medicine, substances
very dissimilar in their nature, have been enlisted into the same
artificial group, and when several of such bodies have, from a reliance upon
their unity of action, been associated together in a medicinal mixture, it
has often happened that, like the armed men of Cadmus, they have opposed
and destroyed each other. The object and application of the black
marginal letters, to which the name of <em>Key Letters</em> has been given, are
fully explained in the First Part of the work, and it is hoped, that the
scheme possesses a more substantial claim to notice than that of mere novelty:
it will be perceived that in the enumeration of the officinal formulæ
these letters are also occasionally introduced, to express the manner in
which the particular substance, under the head of which it stands, operates
in the combination. If any apology be necessary for the introduction of
the medicinal formulæ, it may be offered in the words of Quintillian, who
very justly observes, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In omnibus fere minus valent præcepta quam exempla</span></i>;”
or in the language of Seneca; “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Longum est iter per præcepta, breve et efficax
per exempla</span></i>.” Under the history of each article, I have endeavoured to
concentrate all that is required to be known for its efficacious administration,
such as, 1. <em>Its sensible qualities.</em> 2. <em>Its chemical composition</em>, or the
constituents in which its medicinal activity resides. 3. <em>Its relative solubility
in different menstrua, and the proportions in which it should be mixed, or combined
with different bodies, in order to produce suspension, or saturation.</em> 4.
<em>The Incompatible Substances</em>; that is to say, those substances which are
capable of destroying its properties, or of rendering its flavour or aspect unpleasant
or disgusting. 5. <em>The most eligible forms in which it can be exhibited.</em>
6. <em>Its specific doses.</em> 7. <em>Its Medicinal Uses, and Effects.</em> 8. <em>Its
Preparations, Officinal</em> as well as <em>Extemporaneous</em>. 9. <em>Its Adulterations.</em>
That such information is indispensible for the elegant and successful exhibition
of a remedy, must be sufficiently apparent; the injurious changes
and modifications which substances undergo when they are improperly
combined by the ignorant practitioner, are not as some have supposed imaginary,
the mere <em>deliramenta doctrinæ</em>, or the whimsical suggestions of theoretical
refinement, but they are really such as to render their powers unavailing,
or to impart a dangerous violence to their operation. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unda dabit
flammas et dabit ignis aquas.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the history of the different medicinal preparations, the pharmacopœia
of the London College is the standard to which I have always referred,
although it will be perceived that I have frequently availed myself of
the resources with which the pharmacopœias of Edinburgh and Dublin
abound. To a knowledge of the numerous adulterations to which
each article is so shamefully exposed, too much importance can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>scarcely attached; and under this palpable source of medicinal fallacy
and failure, may be fairly included those secret and illegitimate deviations
from the acknowledged modes of preparation, as laid down in the
pharmacopœia, whether practised as expedients to obtain a lucrative
notoriety, or from a conceit of their being improvements upon the ordinary
processes; for instance, we have lately heard of a wholesale chemist
who professes to supply a syrup of roses of very superior beauty, and
who, for this purpose, substitutes the petals of the <em>red</em> (rosa gallica) for
those of the <em>damask</em> rose (rosa centifolia); we need not be told, that a
preparation of a more exquisite colour may be thus afforded, but allow
me to ask if this <em>underhanded</em> substitution be not a manifest act of injustice
to the medical practitioner, who, instead of a laxative syrup, receives
one which is marked by the opposite character of astringency. These
observations will not apply, of course, to those articles which are <em>avowedly</em>
prepared by a new process; for in that case the practitioner is enabled
to make his election, and either to adopt or refuse them at his discretion.
Thus has Mr. Barry applied his ingenious patent apparatus for
boiling <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</span></i>, to the purpose of making Extracts; we might almost
say <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</span></i>, that the results must be more active than those obtained in
the ordinary way, but they must pass the ordeal of experience before
they can be admitted into practice. As a brief notice of the most notorious<a id='tix'></a>
<em>Quack Medicines</em> may be acceptable, the formulæ for their preparation
have been appended in notes, each being placed at the foot of the
particular article which constitutes its prominent ingredient; indeed it is
essential that the practitioner should be acquainted with their composition,
for although he would refuse to superintend the operation of a
boasted <em>panacea</em>, it is but too probable that he may be called upon to
counteract its baleful influence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Historical Introduction</em>, comprehending the substance of the lectures
delivered before the Royal College of Physicians of London, from
the recently established chair of Materia Medica, has been prefixed to
the work, at the desire of several of the auditors; and I confess my
readiness to comply with this request, as it enabled me at once to obviate
any misconception or unjust representation of those remarks which I
felt it my bounden duty to offer to the College.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be observed that the work itself is divided into two separate
and very distinct parts, the <em>First</em> comprehending the principles of the
art of combination,—the <em>Second</em>, the medicinal history, and chemical habitudes
of the bodies which are the subjects of such combination. These
comprise every legitimate source of instruction, and to the young and
industrious student, they are at once the <span class='sc'>Loom</span> and the <span class='sc'>Raw Material</span>.
Let him therefore abandon those flimsy and ill-adapted textures, that are
kept ready fabricated for the service of ignorance and indolence, and by
actuating the machinery himself, weave the materials with which he is
here presented into the forms and objects that may best fulfil his intentions,
and meet the various exigencies of each particular occasion.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Before I proceed to discuss the particular views which I am prepared
to submit to the College, on the important but obscure subject of medicinal
combination, I propose to take a sweeping and rapid sketch of the different
moral and physical causes which have operated in producing the extraordinary
vicissitudes, so eminently characteristic of the history of Materia
Medica. Such an introduction is naturally suggested by the first
glance at the extensive and motly assemblage of substances with which
our cabinets<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a> are overwhelmed. It is impossible to cast our eyes over
such multiplied groups, without being forcibly struck with the palpable
absurdity of some—the total want of activity in many—and the uncertain
and precarious reputation of all—or, without feeling an eager curiosity to
enquire, from the combination of what causes it can have happened, that
substances, at one period in the highest esteem, and of generally acknowledged
utility, have fallen into total neglect and disrepute;—why others,
of humble pretensions and little significance, have maintained their ground
for so many centuries; and on what account, materials of no energy
whatever, have received the indisputable sanction and unqualified support
of the best and wisest practitioners of the age. That such fluctuations
in opinion and versatility in practice should have produced, even in
the most candid and learned observers, an unfavourable impression with
regard to the general efficacy of medicines, can hardly excite our astonishment,
much less our indignation; nor can we be surprised to find, that
another portion of mankind has at once arraigned Physic as a fallacious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>art, or derided it as a composition of error and fraud.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a> They ask—and it
must be confessed that they ask with reason—what pledge can be afforded
them, that the boasted remedies of the present day will not, like their predecessors,
fall into disrepute, and in their turn serve only as humiliating
memorials of the credulity and infatuation of the physicians who commended
and prescribed them? There is surely no question connected
with our subject which can be more interesting and important, no one
which requires a more cool and dispassionate inquiry, and certainly not
any which can be more appropriate for a lecture, introductory to the history
of Materia Medica. I shall therefore proceed to examine with some
attention the revolutions which have thus taken place in the opinions and
belief of mankind, with regard to the efficacy and powers of different
medicinal agents; such an inquiry, by referring them to causes capable
of a philosophical investigation, is calculated to remove many of the unjust
prejudices which have been excited, to quiet the doubts and alarms
which have been so industriously propagated, and, at the same time, to
obviate the recurrence of several sources of error and disappointment.</p>

<p class='c007'>This moral view of events, without any regard to chronological minutiæ,
may be denominated the <span class='sc'>Philosophy of History</span>, and should be
carefully distinguished from that technical and barren erudition, which
consists in a mere knowledge of <em>names</em> and <em>dates</em>, and which is perused
by the medical student with as much apathy, and as little profit, as the
monk counts his bead-roll. It has been very justly observed, that there
is a certain maturity of the human mind, acquired from generation to generation,
in the <em>mass</em>, as there is in the different stages of life, in the <em>individual</em>
man; what is history, when thus philosophically studied, but the
faithful record of this progress? pointing out for our instruction the various
causes which have retarded or accelerated it in different ages and countries.</p>

<p class='c007'>In tracing the history of the Materia Medica to its earliest periods, we
shall find that its progress towards its present advanced state, has been
very slow and unequal, very unlike the steady and successive improvement
which has attended other branches of natural knowledge; we shall
perceive even that its advancement has been continually arrested, and
often entirely subverted, by the caprices, prejudices, superstitions, and knavery
of mankind; unlike too the other branches of science, it is incapable
of successful generalization; in the progress of the history of remedies,
when are we able to produce a discovery or improvement, which has been
the result of that happy combination of Observation, Analogy, and Experiment,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
which has so eminently rewarded the labours of modern science?
Thus, <span class='sc'>Observation</span> led Newton to discover that the refractive power of
transparent substances was, in general, in the ratio of their density, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>that, of substances of equal density, those which possessed the refractive
power in a higher degree were inflammable.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Analogy</span> induced him to
conclude that, on this account, water must contain an inflammable principle,
and <span class='sc'>Experiment</span> enabled Cavendish and Lavoisier to demonstrate
the surprising truth of Newton’s induction, in their immortal discovery of
the chemical composition of that fluid.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of Astronomy furnishes another illustration equally beautiful
and instructive,—The Astronomer <em>observed</em> certain oscillations in the
motions of Saturn and Jupiter; by <em>Analogy</em> he conjectured that this phenomenon
was produced by the influence of a planet still more remote: a
supposition which was happily confirmed by a telescopic <em>experiment</em>, in
the discovery of Uranus, by Herschel.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is clear that such principles of research, and combination of methods,
can rarely be applied in the investigation of remedies, for every
problem which involves the phenomena of life is unavoidably embarrassed
by circumstances, so complicated in their nature, and fluctuating in their
operation, as to set at defiance every attempt to appreciate their influence;
thus an observation or experiment upon the effects of a medicine is liable
to a thousand fallacies, unless it be carefully repeated under the various
circumstances of health and disease, in different climates, and on different
constitutions. We all know how very differently opium, or mercury, will
act upon different individuals, or even upon the same individual, at different
times, or under different circumstances; the effect of a stimulant upon
the living body is not in the ratio of the intensity of its impulse, but in
proportion to the degree of excitement, or vital susceptibility of the individual,
to whom it is applied. This is illustrated in a clear and familiar
manner, by the very different sensations of heat which the same temperature
will produce under different circumstances. In the road over the
Andes, at about half way between the foot and the summit, there is a
cottage in which the ascending and descending travellers meet; the
former, who have just quitted the sultry vallies at the base, are so relaxed,
that the sudden diminution of temperature produces in them the feeling
of intense cold, whilst the latter, who have left the frozen summits of the
mountain, are overcome by the distressing sensation of extreme heat.</p>

<p class='c007'>But we need not climb the Andes for an illustration; if we plunge one
hand into a basin of hot, and the other into one of cold water, and then
mix the contents of each vessel, and replace both hands in the mixture,
we shall experience the sensation of heat and cold, from one and the
same medium; the hand, that had been previously in the hot, will feel
cold, whilst that which had been immersed in the cold water, will experience
a sensation of heat. Upon the same principle, ardent spirits will
produce very opposite effects upon different constitutions and temperaments,
and we are thus enabled to reconcile the conflicting testimonies
respecting the powers of opium in the cure of fever: aliments, also, which
under ordinary circumstances would occasion but little effect, may in certain
conditions of the system, act as powerful stimulants; a fact which is
well exemplified by the history of persons who have been enclosed in coal
mines for several days without food, from the accidental falling in of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>surrounding strata, when they have been as much intoxicated by a basin
of broth, as a person, in common circumstances, would have been by two
or more bottles of wine.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Many instances will suggest themselves to
the practitioner in farther illustration of these views, and I shall have occasion
to recur to the subject at a future period.</p>

<p class='c007'>To such causes we must attribute the barren labours of the ancient
empirics, who saw without discerning, administered without discriminating,
and concluded without reasoning; nor should we be surprised at the
very imperfect state of the materia medica, as far as it depends upon what
is commonly called experience, complicated as this subject is by its numberless
relations with Physiology, Pathology, and Chemistry. John Ray
attempted to enumerate the virtues of plants from <em>experience</em>, and the system
serves only to commemorate his failure. Vogel likewise professed to
assign to substances, those powers which had been learnt from accumulated
experience; and he speaks of <em>roasted toad</em><a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a> as a specific for the pains
of gout, and asserts that a person may secure himself for the whole year
from angina by eating a roasted swallow! Such must ever be the case,
when medicines derive their origin from false experience, and their reputation
from blind credulity.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Analogy</span> has undoubtedly been a powerful instrument in the improvement,
extension, and correction of the materia medica, but it has been
chiefly confined to modern times; for in the earlier ages, Chemistry had
not so far unfolded the composition of bodies, as to furnish any just idea of
their relations to each other, nor had the science of Botany taught us the
value and importance of the natural affinities which exist in the vegetable
kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to the fallacies to which such analogies are exposed, I
shall hereafter speak at some length, and examine the pretensions of those
<em>ultra</em> chemists of the present day who have upon every occasion arraigned,
at their self-constituted tribunal, the propriety of our medicinal combinations,
and the validity of our national pharmacopœias.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the obstacles already enumerated, the progress of our
knowledge respecting the virtues of medicines has met with others of a
moral character, which have deprived us in a great degree of another obvious
method of research, and rendered our dependance upon testimony
uncertain, and often entirely fallacious. The human understanding, as
Lord Bacon justly remarks, is not a mere faculty of apprehension, but is
affected, more or less, by the will and the passions; what man wishes to
be true, that he too easily believes to be so, and I conceive that physic
has, of all the sciences, the least pretensions to proclaim itself independent
of the empire of the passions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In our researches to discover and fix the period when remedies were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>first applied for the alleviation of bodily suffering, we are soon lost in conjecture,
or involved in fable; we are unable to reach the period in any
country, when the inhabitants were destitute of medical resources, and
we find among the most uncultivated tribes, that medicine is cherished as
a blessing and practised as an art, as by the inhabitants of New Holland
and New Zealand, by those of Lapland and Greenland, of North America,
and of the interior of Africa. The personal feelings of the sufferer,
and the anxiety of those about him, must, in the rudest state of society,
have incited a spirit of industry and research to procure alleviation, the
modification of heat and cold, of moisture and dryness, and the regulation
and change of diet and habit, must have intuitively suggested themselves
for the relief of pain;<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and when these resources failed, charms, amulets,
and incantations,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> were the natural expedients of the barbarian, ever
more inclined to indulge the delusive hope of superstition, than to
listen to the voice of sober reason. Traces of amulets may be discovered
in very early history. The learned Dr. Warburton is evidently
mistaken, when he assigns the origin of these magical instruments to the
age of the Ptolemies, which was not more than 300 years before Christ;
this is at once refuted by the testimony of Galen, who tells us that the
Egyptian king, Nechepsus, who lived 630 years before the Christian era,
had written, that a green jasper cut into the form of a dragon surrounded
with rays, if applied externally, would strengthen the stomach and organs
of digestion.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a> We have moreover the authority of the Scriptures in
support of this opinion; for what were the ear-rings which Jacob buried
under the oak of Sechem, as related in Genesis, but amulets? and we
are informed by Josephus, in his Antiquities of the Jews,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a> that Solomon
discovered a plant efficacious in the cure of Epilepsy, and that he employed
the aid of a charm or spell for the purpose of assisting its virtues;
the root of the herb was concealed in a ring, which was applied to the
nostrils of the Demoniac, and Josephus remarks that he himself saw a
Jewish Priest practise the art of Solomon with complete success in the
presence of Vespasian, his sons, and the tribunes of the Roman army.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
Nor were such means confined to dark and barbarous ages; Theophrastus
pronounced Pericles to be insane, because he discovered that he wore an
amulet about his neck; and, in the declining æra of the Roman empire,
we find that this superstitious custom was so general, that the Emperor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Caracalla was induced to make a public edict ordaining that no man
should wear any superstitious amulets about his person.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the progress of civilization, various fortuitous incidents,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a> and even
errors in the choice and preparation of aliments, must have gradually unfolded
the remedial powers of many natural substances; these were recorded,
and the authentic history of medicine may date its commencement
from the period when such records began.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Chaldeans and Babylonians, we are told by Herodotus, carried
their sick to the public roads and markets, that travellers might converse
with them, and communicate any remedies which had been successfully
used in similar cases; this custom continued during many ages in Assyria;
and Strabo states that it prevailed also amongst the ancient Lusitanians,
or Portuguese: in this manner, however, the results of experience
descended only by oral tradition; it was in the temple of Esculapius
in Greece that medical information was first recorded; diseases and cures
were there registered on durable tablets of marble; the priests<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and
priestesses, who were the guardians of the temple, prepared the remedies
and directed their application, and thus commenced the profession of Physic.
With respect to the actual nature of these remedies, it is useless to
inquire; the lapse of ages, loss of records, change of language, and ambiguity
of description, have rendered every learned research unsatisfactory;
indeed we are in doubt with regard to many of the medicines which
even Hippocrates employed. It is however clearly shewn by the earliest
records, that the ancients were in the possession of many powerful remedies;
thus Melampus of Argos, the most ancient Greek physician
with whom we are acquainted, is said to have cured one of the Argonauts
of sterility, by administering the rust of iron in wine for ten days;
and the same physician used hellebore as a purge, on the daughters of
king Prætus, who were afflicted with melancholy. Venesection was
also a remedy of very early origin; for Podalirius, on his return from the
Trojan war, cured the daughter of Damethus, who had fallen from a
height, by bleeding her in both arms. Opium, or a preparation of the
poppy, was certainly known in the earliest ages; it was probably opium
that Helen mixed with wine, and gave to the guests of Menelaus, under
the expressive name of <em>nepenthe</em>,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> to drive away their cares, and increase
their hilarity; and this conjecture receives much support from the fact,
that the <em>nepenthe</em> of Homer was obtained from the Egyptian Thebes;<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>and if we may credit the opinion of Dr. Darwin, the Cumæan Sibyll never
sat on the portending tripod without first swallowing a few drops of
the juice of the <em>Cherry-laurel</em>.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There is reason to believe that the Pagan priesthood were under the
influence of some powerful narcotic during the display of their oracular
powers, but the effects produced would seem to resemble rather those of
Opium, or perhaps of Stramonium, than of the Prussic acid. Monardes
tells us that the priests of the American Indians, whenever they were
consulted by the chief gentlemen, or <em>casiques</em> as they are called, took certain
leaves of the Tobacco, and cast them into the fire, and then received
the smoke, which they thus produced, in their mouths, in consequence of
which they fell down upon the ground; and that after having remained
for some time in a stupor, they recovered, and delivered the answers which
they pretended to have received, during their supposed intercourse with
the world of spirits.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sedative powers of the <em>Lactuca Sativa</em>, or Lettuce,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a> were known
also in the earliest times; among the fables of antiquity, we read that
after the death of Adonis, Venus threw herself on a bed of lettuces, to
lull her grief, and repress her desires. The sea onion or <em>Squill</em>, was administered
in cases of dropsy by the Egyptians, under the mystic title of
the <em>Eye of Typhon</em>. The practices of incision and scarification were employed
in the camp of the Greeks before Troy, and the application of spirit
to wounds was also understood, for we find the experienced Nestor applying
a cataplasm, composed of cheese, onion, and meal, mixed up
with the wine of Pramnos, to the wounds of Machaon.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The revolutions and vicissitudes which remedies have undergone, in
medical as well as popular opinion, from the ignorance of some ages, the
learning of others, the superstitions of the weak, and the designs of the
crafty, afford ample subject for philosophical reflection; some of these revolutions
I shall proceed to investigate, classing them under the prominent
causes which have produced them, viz. Superstition—Credulity—Scepticism—False
Theory—Devotion to Authority, and Established
Routine—The assigning to Art that which was the effect of unassisted
Nature—The assigning to peculiar substances Properties, deduced from
Experiments made on inferior Animals—Ambiguity of Nomenclature—The
progress of Botanical Science—The application, and misapplication
of Chemical Philosophy—The Influence of Climate and Season on Diseases,
as well as on the properties, and operations of their Remedies—The
ignorant Preparation, or fraudulent Adulteration of Medicines—The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>unseasonable collection of those remedies which are of vegetable origin,—and,
the obscurity which has attended the operation of compound medicines.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>SUPERSTITION.</h3>

<p class='c018'>A belief in the interposition of supernatural powers in the direction of
earthly events, has prevailed in every age and country, in an inverse ratio
with its state of civilization, or in the exact proportion to its want of
knowledge. “In the opinion of the ignorant multitude,” says Lord Bacon,
“witches and impostors have always held a competition with physicians.”
Galen also complains of this circumstance, and observes that his
patients were more obedient to the oracle in the temple of Esculapius, or
to their own dreams, than they were to his prescriptions. The same popular
imbecility is evidently allegorized in the mythology of the ancient
poets, when they made both <span class='sc'>Esculapius</span> and <span class='sc'>Circe</span> the children of <span class='sc'>Apollo</span>;
in truth, there is an unaccountable propensity in the human mind,
unless subjected to a very long course of discipline, to indulge in the belief
of what is improbable and supernatural; and this is perhaps more conspicuous
with respect to physic than to any other affair of common life, both
because the nature of diseases and the art of curing them are more obscure,
and because disease necessarily awakens fear, and fear and ignorance
are the natural parents of superstition; every disease therefore, the
origin and cause of which did not immediately strike the senses, has in
all ages been attributed by the ignorant to the wrath of heaven, to the
resentment of some invisible demon, or to some malignant aspect of the
stars;<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a> and hence the introduction of a rabble of superstitious remedies,
not a few of which were rather intended as expiations at the shrines of
these offended spirits, than as natural agents possessing medicinal powers.
The introduction of precious stones into the materia medica, arose from
an Arabian superstition of this kind; indeed De Boot, who has written
extensively upon the subject, does not pretend to account for the virtues
of gems, upon any philosophical principle, but from their being the residence
of spirits, and he adds that such substances, from their beauty,
splendour and value, are well adapted as receptacles for <em>good</em> spirits!<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Every substance whose origin is involved in mystery,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a> has at different
times been eagerly applied to the purposes of medicine: not long since,
one of those showers which are now known to consist of the excrement
of insects, fell in the north of Italy; the inhabitants regarded it as Manna,
or some supernatural panacea, and they swallowed it with such avidity,
that it was only by extreme address, that a small quantity was obtained
for a chemical examination.</p>

<p class='c007'>A propensity to attribute every ordinary and natural effect to some extraordinary
and unnatural cause, is one of the striking peculiarities of
medical superstition; it seeks also explanations from the most preposterous
agents, when obvious and natural ones are in readiness to solve the
problem. Soranus, for instance, who was cotemporary with Galen, and
wrote the life of Hippocrates!<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a> tells us that honey proved an easy remedy
for the aphthæ of children, but instead of at once referring the fact to
the medical qualities of the honey, he very gravely explains it, from its
having been taken from bees that hived near the tomb of Hippocrates!
And even those salutary virtues which many herbs possess, were, in these
times of superstitious delusion, attributed rather to the planet under whose
ascendancy they were collected or prepared, than to any natural and intrinsic
properties in the plants themselves; indeed such was the supposed
importance of planetary influence,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a> that it was usual to prefix to receipts
a symbol of the planet under whose reign the ingredients were to be collected,
and it is not perhaps generally known, that the character which
we at this day place at the head of our prescriptions, and which is understood,
and supposed to mean <em>Recipe</em>, is a relict of the astrological symbol
of Jupiter, as may be seen in many of the older works on pharmacy, although
it is at present so disguised by the addition of the down stroke,
which converts it into the letter ℞, that were it not for its <em>cloven</em> foot, we
might be led to question the fact of its superstitious origin.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
<img src='images/illo_012.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'>A knowledge of this ancient and popular belief in Sideral influence,
will enable us to explain many superstitions in Physic; the custom, for
instance, of administering cathartic medicines at stated periods and seasons,
originated in an impression of their being more active at particular
stages of the moon, or at certain conjunctions of the planets: a remnant
of this superstition still exists to a considerable extent in Germany; and
the practice of bleeding at ‘spring and fall,’ so long observed in this country,
owed its existence to a similar belief. It was in consequence of the
same superstition, that the metals were first distinguished by the names
and signs of the planets; and as the latter were supposed to hold dominion
over time, so were astrologers led to believe that some, more than others,
had an influence on certain days of the week; and, moreover, that they
could impart to the corresponding metals considerable efficacy upon the
particular days which were devoted to them;<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a> from the same belief,
some bodies were only prepared on certain days in the year; the celebrated
earth of Lemnos was, as Galen describes, periodically dug with great
ceremony, and it continued for many ages to be highly esteemed for its
virtues; even at this day, the pit in which the clay is found is annually
opened, with solemn rites by the priests, on the sixth day of August, six
hours after sun rising, when a quantity is taken out, washed, dried, and
then sealed with the Grand Signior’s seal, and sent to Constantinople.
Formerly it was death to open the pit, or to seal the earth, on any other
day in the year. In the botanical history of the middle ages, as more especially
developed in Macer’s Herbal, there was not a plant of medicinal
use, that was not placed under the dominion of some planet, and must
neither be gathered nor applied but with observances that savoured of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>most absurd superstition, and which we find were preserved as late as the
seventeenth century, by the astrological herbalists, Turner, Culpepper,
and Lovel.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not the least extraordinary feature in the history of medical superstition,
that it should so frequently involve in its trammels persons who,
on every other occasion, would resent with indignation any attempt to
talk them out of their reason, and still more so, to persuade them out of
their senses; and yet we have continual proofs of its extensive influence
over powerful and cultivated minds; in ancient times we may adduce the
wise Cicero, and the no less philosophical Aurelius, while in modern days
we need only recall to our recollection the number of persons of superior
rank and intelligence, who were actually persuaded to submit to the magnetising
operations of Miss Prescott, and some of them were even induced
to believe that a beneficial influence had been produced by the spells of
this modern Circe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Bacon, with all his philosophy, betrayed a disposition to believe
in the virtue of charms and amulets; and Boyle<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c015'><sup>[25]</sup></a> seriously recommends
the thigh bone of an executed criminal, as a powerful remedy in dysentery.
Amongst the remedies of Sir Theodore Mayerne, known to commentators
as the Doctor Caius of Shakspeare, who was physician to three English
Sovereigns, and who, by his personal authority, put an end to the distinctions
of chemical and galenical practitioners in England, we shall find
the secundines of a woman in her first labour with a male child; the
bowels of a mole, cut open alive; mummy made of the lungs of a man
who had died a violent death; with a variety of remedies, equally absurd,
and alike disgusting.</p>

<p class='c007'>It merits notice, that the medicinal celebrity of a substance has not
unfrequently survived the tradition of its superstitious origin, in the same
manner that many of our popular customs and rites have continued,
through a series of years, to exact a respectful observance, although the
circumstances which gave origin to them have been obscured and lost in
the gloom of unrecorded ages. Does not the fond parent still suspend
the coral toy around the neck of her infant, without being in the least
aware of the superstitious belief<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a> from which the custom originated?
while the chorus of <em>derry down</em> is re-echoed by those who never heard of
the Druids, much less of the choral hymns with which their groves resounded,
at the time of their gathering the misletoe; and how many a
medical practitioner continues to administer this sacred plant, (<em>Viscus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Quercinus</em>) for the cure of his epileptic patients, without the least suspicion
that it owes its reputation to the same mysterious source of superstition
and imposture? Nor is this the only faint vestige of druidism which can
be adduced. Mr. Lightfoot states, with much plausibility, that in the
highlands of Scotland, evidence still exists in proof of the high esteem in
which those ancient Magi held the Quicken tree, or Mountain Ash, (<em>Sorbus
Aucuparia</em>) for it is more frequently than any other, found planted in the
neighbourhood of druidical circles of stones; and it is a curious fact, that
it should be still believed that a small part of this tree, carried about a person,
is a charm against all bodily evils,—the dairy-maid drives the cattle
with a switch of the <em>Roan</em> tree, for so it is called in the highlands; and in
one part of Scotland, the sheep and lambs are, on the first of May, ever
made to pass through a hoop of <em>Roan wood</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is also necessary to state, that many of the practices which superstition
has at different times suggested, have not been alike absurd; nay,
some of them have even possessed, by accident, natural powers of considerable
efficacy, whilst others, although, ridiculous in themselves, have actually
led to results and discoveries of great practical importance. The
most remarkable instance of this kind upon record is that of the <em>Sympathetic</em>
powder of Sir Kenelm Digby,<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a> Knight of Montpellier. Whenever
any wound had been inflicted, this powder was applied to the weapon
that had inflicted it, which was, moreover, covered with ointment, and
dressed two or three times a-day.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a> The wound itself in the mean time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>was directed to be brought together, and carefully bound up with clean
linen rags, but, <span class='fss'>ABOVE ALL, TO BE LET ALONE</span> for seven days; at the end
of which period the bandages were removed, when the wound was generally
found perfectly united. The triumph of the cure was decreed to the
mysterious agency of the sympathetic powder which had been so assiduously
applied to the weapon; whereas, it is hardly necessary to observe,
that the promptness of the cure depended upon the total exclusion of air
from the wound, and upon the sanative operations of nature not having
received any disturbance from the officious interference of art; the result,
beyond all doubt, furnished the first hint, which led surgeons to the improved
practice of healing wounds by what is technically called the <em>first
intention</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rust of the spear of Telephus, mentioned in Homer as a cure for
the wounds which that weapon inflicted, was probably <em>Verdegris</em>, and led
to the discovery of its use as a surgical application.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after the introduction of Gunpowder, <em>cold water</em> was very generally
employed throughout Italy, as a dressing to gun-shot wounds; not
however from any theory connected with the influence of diminished temperature
or of moisture, but from a belief in a supernatural agency imparted
to it by certain mysterious and magical ceremonies, which were duly
performed immediately previous to its application: the continuance of the
practice, however, threw some light upon the surgical treatment of these
wounds, and led to a more rational management of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The inoculation of the small-pox in India, Turkey, and Wales, observes
Sir Gilbert Blane, was practised on a superstitious principle, long before it
was introduced as a rational practice into this country. The superstition
consisted in buying it—for the efficacy of the operation, in giving safety,
was supposed to depend upon a piece of money being left by the person
who took it for insertion. The members of the National Vaccine Establishment,
during the period I had a seat at the board, received from Mr.
Dubois, a Missionary in India, a very interesting account of the services,
derived from superstitious influence, in propagating the practice of vaccination
through that uncivilized part of the globe. It appears from this
document, that the greatest obstacle which vaccination encountered was a
belief that the natural small-pox was a dispensation of a mischievous
deity among them, whom they called <span class='sc'>Mah-ry Umma</span>, or rather, that this
disease was an incarnation of the dire Goddess herself, into the person
who was infected with it; the fear of irritating her, and of exposing
themselves to her resentment, necessarily rendered the natives of the East
decidedly averse to vaccination, until a superstitious impression, equally
powerful with respect to the new practice, was happily effected; this was
no other than a belief, that the Goddess <span class='sc'>Mah-ry Umma</span> had spontaneously
chosen this new and milder mode of manifesting herself to her votaries,
and that she might be worshipped with equal respect under this
new shape.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Hydromancy</span> is another superstition which has incidentally led to the
discovery of the medicinal virtues of many mineral waters; a belief in
the divining nature of certain springs and fountains is, perhaps, the most
ancient and universal of all superstitions. The Castalian fountain, and
many others amongst the Grecians, were supposed to be of a prophetic
nature; by dipping a fair mirror into a well, the Patræans of Greece received,
as they imagined, some notice of ensuing sickness or health. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>this very day, the sick and lame are attracted to various hallowed
springs; and to this practice, which has been observed for so many ages
and in such different countries, we are no doubt indebted for a knowledge
of the sanative powers of many mineral waters. There can be no doubt,
moreover, but that in many cases, by affording encouragement and confidence
to a dejected patient, and serenity to his mind, whether by the aid
of reason or the influence of superstition, much benefit may arise; for
the salutary and curative efforts of nature, in such a state of mind, must
be much more likely to succeed; equally evident is it, that the most
powerful effects may be induced by the administration of remedies
which, from their disgusting nature, are calculated to excite strong and
painful sensations of the mind.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a> Celsus mentions, with confidence, several
medicines of this kind for the cure of Epilepsy, as <em>the warm blood of
a recently slain Gladiator</em>, or a certain portion of <em>human</em>, or <em>horse flesh</em>! and
we find that remedies of this description were actually exhibited, and
with success, by Kaw Boerhaave, in the cure of Epileptics in the poor-house
at Haerlem. The powerful influence of confidence in the cure and
prevention of disease, was well understood by the sages of antiquity; the
Romans, in times of pestilence, elected a dictator with great solemnity,
for the sole purpose of driving a nail into the wall of the temple of Jupiter—the
effect was generally instantaneous—and while they thus imagined
that they propitiated an offended deity, they in truth did but diminish
the susceptibility to disease, by appeasing their own fears. Nor are
there wanting in modern times, striking examples of the progress of an
epidemic disease having been suddenly arrested by some exhilarating impression
made upon the mass of the population.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the celebrated siege of Breda, in 1625, by Spinola, the garrison suffered
extreme distress from the ravages of Scurvy, and the Prince of
Orange being unable to relieve the place, sent in, by a confidential messenger,
a preparation which was directed to be added to a very large
quantity of water, and to be given as a specific for the epidemic; the remedy
was administered, and the garrison recovered its health, when it
was afterwards acknowledged, that the substance in question was no
other than a little colouring matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amongst the numerous instances which have been cited to shew the
power of faith over disease, or of the mind over the body, the <em>cures performed
by Royal Touch</em><a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a> have been generally selected; but it would appear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>upon the authority of Wiseman, that the cures which were thus effected,
were in reality produced by a very different cause; for he states,
that part of the duty of the Royal Physicians and Serjeant Surgeons was
to select such patients, afflicted with scrofula, as evinced a tendency towards
recovery, and that they took especial care to choose those who approached
the age of puberty; in short, those only were produced whom
nature had shewn a disposition to cure; and as the touch of the king,
like the sympathetic powder of Digby, secured the patient from the mischievous
importunities of art, so were the efforts of nature left free and
uncontrolled, and the cure of the disease was not retarded or opposed by
the operation of adverse remedies. The wonderful cures of Valentine
Greatracks, performed in 1666, which were witnessed by cotemporary
prelates, members of parliament, and fellows of the royal society,
amongst whom was the celebrated Mr. Boyle, would probably upon investigation
admit of a similar explanation; it deserves, however, to be
noticed, that in all records of extraordinary cures performed by mysterious
agents, there is a great desire to conceal the remedies and other curative
means, which were simultaneously administered with them; thus Oribasius
commends in high terms a necklace of <em>Pœony root</em>, for the cure of
Epilepsy; but we learn that he always took care to accompany its use
with copious evacuations, although he assigns to them no share of credit
in the cure. In later times we have a good specimen of this deception presented
to us in a work on Scrofula, by Mr. Morley, written, as we are informed,
for the sole purpose of restoring the much injured character and
use of the <em>Vervain</em>; in which the author directs the root of this plant to
be tied with a <em>yard of whited satin ribband</em>, around the neck, where it is to
remain until the patient is cured; but mark,—during this interval he calls
to his aid the most active medicines in the materia medica!</p>

<p class='c007'>The advantages which I have stated to have occasionally arisen from
superstitious influence, must be understood as being generally accidental;
indeed, in the history of superstitious practices, we do not find that their
application was exclusively commended in cases likely to be influenced
by the powers of faith or of the imagination, but, on the contrary, that
they were as frequently directed in affections that were entirely placed
beyond the control of the mind. Homer tells us, for instance, that the
bleeding of Ulysses was stopped by a charm:<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a> and Cato the censor has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>favoured us with an incantation for the reduction of a dislocated limb. In
certain instances, however, we are certainly bound to admit that the
pagan priesthood, with their characteristic cunning, were careful to perform
their superstitious incantations, in such cases only as were likely to
receive the sanative assistance of Nature, so that they might attribute
the fortunate results of her efforts, to the potent influence of their own
arts. The extraordinary success which is related to have attended various
superstitious ceremonials will thus find a plausible explanation: the
miraculous gift, attributed by Herodotus to the Priestesses of Helen, is
one amongst many others of this kind that might be adduced; the Grecian
historian relates, that when the heads of ugly infants were adjusted on
the altar of this temple, the individuals so treated acquired comeliness, and
even beauty, as they advanced in growth: but is not such a change the
ordinary and unassisted result of natural developement? Those large and
prominent outlines which impart an unpleasing physiognomy to the infant,
when proportioned and matured by growth, will generally assume
features of intelligence in the adult face.</p>

<p class='c007'>I shall conclude these observations, by remarking that, in the history of
religious ceremonials, we sometimes discover that they were intended to
preserve useful customs or to conceal important truths; which, had they
not been thus <em>embalmed</em> by superstition, could never have been perpetuated
for the use and advantage of posterity. I shall illustrate this assertion by
one or two examples. Whenever the ancients proposed to build a town,
or to pitch a camp, a sacrifice was offered to the gods, and the Soothsayer
declared, <em>from the appearance of the entrails</em>, whether they were propitious
or not to the design. What was this but a physiological inquiry into the
salubrity of the situation, and the purity of the waters that supplied it?
for we well know that in unwholesome districts, especially when swampy,
the cattle will uniformly present an appearance of disease in the viscera,
which an experienced eye can readily detect; and when we reflect upon
the age and climate in which these ceremonies were performed, we cannot
but believe that their introduction was suggested by principles of wise and
useful policy. In the same manner, <em>Bathing</em>, which at one period of the
world, was essentially necessary, to prevent the diffusion of Leprosy, and
other infectious diseases, was wisely converted into an act of religion, and
the priests persuaded the people that they could only obtain absolution
on washing away their sins by frequent ablutions; but since the use of
linen shirts has become general, and every one has provided for the cleanliness
of his own person, the frequent bath ceases to be so essential, and
therefore no evil has arisen from the change of religious belief respecting
its connection with the welfare and purity of the soul. Among the religious
impurities and rules of purification of the Hindoos, we shall be able
to discern the same principle although distorted by the grossest superstition.
The ancient custom of erecting “<em>Acerræ</em>” or Altars, near the bed
of the deceased, in order that his friends might daily <em>burn Incense</em> until his
burial, was long practised by the Romans. The Chinese observe a similar
custom; they place upon the altar thus erected an image of the dead
person, to which every one who approaches it bows four times, and offers
oblations and <em>perfumes</em>. Can there be any difficulty in recognising, in
this tribute to the dead, a wise provision for the preservation of the living?
The original intention was, beyond doubt, to overcome any offensive
smell, and to obviate the dangers that might arise from the emanations of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the corpse. These instances are sufficient to shew the justness of my
position: if time and space would allow, many others of a striking and
interesting character might be adduced.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>CREDULITY.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Although it is nearly allied to Superstition, yet it differs very widely
from it. Credulity is an unbounded belief in what is possible, although
destitute of proof and perhaps of probability; but Superstition is a belief
in what is wholly repugnant to the laws of the physical and moral world.
Thus, if we believe that an inert plant possesses any remedial power, we
are <em>credulous</em>; but if we were to fancy that, by carrying it about with us,
we should become invulnerable, we should in that case be <em>superstitious</em>.
Credulity is a far greater source of error than Superstition; for the latter
must be always more limited in its influence, and can exist only, to any
considerable extent, in the most ignorant portion of society; whereas the
former diffuses itself through the minds of all classes, by which the rank
and dignity of science are degraded, its valuable labours confounded with
the vain pretensions of empiricism, and ignorance is enabled to claim for
itself the prescriptive right of delivering oracles, amidst all the triumphs
of truth, and the progress of philosophy. This is very lamentable; and
yet, if it were even possible to remove the film that thus obscures the
public discernment, I question whether the adoption of such a plan would
not be outvoted by the majority of our own profession. In Chili, says
Zimmerman, the physicians blow around the beds of their patients to drive
away diseases; and as the people in that country believe that physic consists
wholly in this wind, their doctors would take it very ill of any person
who should attempt to make the method of cure more difficult—<em>they think
they know enough, when they know how to blow</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this mental imbecility is not characteristic of any age or country.
England has, indeed, by a late continental writer,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a> been accused of possessing
a larger share of credulity than its neighbours, and it has been
emphatically called “<em>The Paradise of Quacks</em>,” but with as little truth as
candour. If we refer to the works of Ætius, written more than 1300
years ago, we shall discover the existence of a similar infirmity with regard
to physic. This author has collected a multitude of receipts, particularly
those that had been celebrated, or used as <em>Nostrums</em>,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a> many of
which he mentions with no other view than to expose their folly, and to
inform us at what an extravagant price they were purchased. We accordingly
learn from him that the collyrium of Danaus was sold at Constantinople
for 120 numismata, and the cholical antidote of Nicostratus for
two talents; in short, we shall find an unbounded credulity with respect
to the powers of inert medicines, from the elixir and <em>alkahest</em> of Paracelsus
and Van-Helmont, to the tar water of bishop Berkeley, the metallic tractors
of Perkins, the animal magnetism of Miss Prescott, and may I not add,
with equal justice, to the nitro-muriatic acid bath of Dr. Scott? The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>description of Thessalus, the Roman empiric in the reign of Nero, as
drawn by Galen, applies with equal fidelity and force to the medical
Charlatan of the present day; and, if we examine the writings of Scribonius
Largus, we shall obtain ample evidence that the same ungenerous
selfishness of keeping medicines secret, prevailed in ancient no less than
in modern times; while we have only to read the sacred orations of Aristides
to be satisfied, that the flagrant conduct of the Asclepiades, from
which he so severely suffered,<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c015'><sup>[35]</sup></a> was the very prototype of the cruel and
remorseless frauds, so wickedly practised by the unprincipled Quack Doctors
and advertising “<em>Medical Boards</em>,” of our own times: and I challenge
the apologist of ancient purity to produce a more glaring instance of empirical
effrontery and success, in the annals of the nineteenth century,
than that of the sacred impostor described in the Alexander of Lucian,
who established himself in the deserted temple of Esculapius, and entrapped
in his snares some of the most eminent of the Roman senators.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>SCEPTICISM.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Credulity has been justly defined, <em>Belief without Reason</em>. Scepticism
is its opposite, <em>Reason without Belief</em> and is the natural and invariable
consequence of credulity: for it may be generally observed, that men who
believe without reason, are succeeded by others whom no reasoning can
convince; a fact which has occasioned many extraordinary and violent
revolutions in the <em>Materia Medica</em>, and a knowledge of it will enable us
to explain the otherwise unaccountable rise and fall of many useless, as
well as important articles. It will also suggest to the reflecting practitioner,
a caution of great moment, to avoid the dangerous fault imputed
to Galen by Dioscorides, of ascribing too many and too great virtues to
one and the same medicine. <em>By bestowing unworthy and extravagant praise
upon a remedy, we in reality do but detract from its reputation,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c015'><sup>[36]</sup></a> and run the
risk of banishing it from practice</em>; for when the sober practitioner discovers
by experience that a medicine falls so far short of the efficacy ascribed to
it, he abandons its use in disgust, and is even unwilling to concede to it
that degree of merit to which in truth and justice it may be entitled; the
inflated eulogiums bestowed upon the operation of <em>Digitalis</em> in pulmonary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>diseases, excited, for a time, a very unfair impression against its use; and
the injudicious manner in which the antisyphilitic<a id='t21'></a> powers of <em>Nitric Acid</em>
have been aggrandised, had very nearly exploded a valuable auxiliary
from modern practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well known with what avidity the public embraced the expectations
given by Stöerk of Vienna in 1760, with respect to the efficacy of
<em>Hemlock</em>; every body, says Dr. Fothergill, made the extract, and every
body prescribed it, but finding that it would not perform the wonders ascribed
to it, and that a multitude of discordant diseases refused to yield,
as it was asserted they would, to its narcotic powers, practitioners fell
into the opposite extreme of absurdity, and declaring that it could do nothing
at all, dismissed it at once as inert and useless. Can we not then
predict the fate of the <em>Cubebs</em>, which has been lately restored to notice
with such extravagant praise and unqualified approbation? May the
sanguine advocates for the virtues of the Colchicum derive a useful lesson
of practical caution from these precepts: it would be a matter of regret
that a remedy which, under skilful management, certainly possesses considerable
virtue, should again fall into obscurity and neglect from the disgust
excited by the extravagant zeal of its supporters.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are, moreover, those who cherish a spirit of scepticism, from an
idea that it denotes the exercise of a superior intellect; it must be admitted,
that at that period in the history of Europe, when reason first began
to throw off the yoke of authority, it required superiority of understanding
as well as intrepidity of conduct, to resist the powers of that superstition
which had so long held it in captivity; but in the present age,
observes Mr. Dugald Stewart, “<em>unlimited scepticism is as much the child of
imbecility as implicit credulity</em>.” “He who at the end of the eighteenth
century,” says Rousseau, “has brought himself to abandon all his early
principles, without discrimination, would probably have been a bigot in
the days of the league.”</p>

<h3 class='c017'>FALSE THEORIES, AND ABSURD CONCEITS.</h3>

<p class='c018'>He who is governed by preconceived opinions, may be compared to a
spectator who views the surrounding objects through coloured glasses,
each assuming a tinge similar to that of the glass employed; thus have
crowds of inert and insignificant drugs been indebted to an ephemeral popularity,
from the prevalence of a false theory; the celebrated hypothesis
of Galen respecting the virtues and operation of medicines, may serve as
an example; it is a web of philosophical fiction, which was never surpassed
in absurdity. He conceives that the properties of all medicines
are derived from what he calls their elementary or <em>cardinal</em> qualities, <span class='sc'>Heat</span>,
<span class='sc'>Cold</span>, <span class='sc'>Moisture</span>, and <span class='sc'>Dryness</span>. Each of these qualities is again sub-divided
into four degrees, and a plant or medicine, according to his notion,
is cold or hot, in the first, second, third, or fourth gradation; if the disease
be hot, or cold in any of these four stages, a medicine possessed of a contrary
quality, and in the same proportionate degree of elementary heat or
cold, must be prescribed. Saltness, bitterness, and acridness depend, in
his idea, upon the relative degrees of heat and dryness in different bodies.
It will be easily seen how a belief in such an hypothesis must have multiplied
the list of inert articles in the materia medica, and have corrupted the
practice of physic. The variety of seeds derived its origin from this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>source, and until lately, medical writers, in the true jargon of Galen, spoke
of the <em>four</em> greater and lesser <em>hot</em> and <em>cold</em> seeds; and in the London Dispensatory
of 1721, we find the powders of <em>hot</em> and <em>cold</em> precious stones,
and those of the <em>hot</em> and <em>cold</em> compound powders of pearl. Several of the
ancient combinations of opium, with various aromatics, are also indebted
to Galen for their origin, and to the blind influence of his authority for
their existence and lasting reputation. Galen asserted that opium was
<em>cold in the fourth degree</em>, and must therefore require some corresponding hot
medicine to moderate its frigidity.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c015'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Methodic Sect</span>, which was founded by the Roman physician
Themison,<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c015'><sup>[38]</sup></a> a disciple of Asclepiades, as they conceived all diseases to
depend upon <em>overbracing</em>, or on <em>relaxation</em>, so did they class all medicines
under the head of <em>relaxing</em> and <em>bracing</em> remedies; and although this
theory has been long since banished from the schools, yet it continues at
this day to exert a secret influence on medical practice, and to preserve
from neglect some unimportant medicines. The general belief in the relaxing
effect of the <em>warm</em>, and the equally strengthening influence of the
<em>cold</em> bath, may be traced to conclusions deduced from the operations of hot
and cold water upon parchment and other inert bodies.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c015'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Stahlians</span>, under the impression of their ideal system, introduced
<em>Archœal</em> remedies, and many of a superstitious and inert kind; whilst, as
they on all occasions trusted to the constant attention and wisdom of nature,
so did they zealously oppose the use of some of the most efficacious
instruments of art, as the Peruvian <em>bark</em>; and few physicians were so reserved
in the use of general remedies, as bleeding, vomiting, and the like;
their practice was therefore imbecile, and it has been aptly enough denominated,
“<em>a meditation upon death</em>.” They were however vigilant in observation
and acute in discernment, and we are indebted to them for some
faithful and minute descriptions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Mechanical Theory</span>, which recognised “<em>lentor and morbid viscidity
of the blood</em>,” as the principal cause of all diseases, introduced attenuant
and diluent medicines, or substances endued with some mechanical
force; thus Fourcroy explained the operation of mercury by its specific
gravity,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c015'><sup>[40]</sup></a> and the advocates of this doctrine favoured the general introduction
of the preparations of iron, especially in schirrus of the spleen or
liver, upon the same hypothetical principle; for, say they, whatever is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>most forcible in removing the obstruction, must be the most proper instrument
of cure; such is <em>Steel</em>, which, besides the attenuating power with
which it is furnished, has still a greater force in this case from the <em>gravity</em>
of its particles, which, being seven times specifically heavier than any vegetable,
acts in proportion with a stronger impulse, and therefore is a more
powerful deobstruent. This may be taken as a specimen of the style in
which these mechanical physicians reasoned and practised.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Chemists</span>, as they acknowledged no source of disease but the
presence of some hostile acid or alkali, or some deranged condition in the
chemical composition of the fluid or solid parts, so they conceived all remedies
must act by producing chemical changes in the body. We find
Tournefort busily engaged in testing every vegetable juice, in order to
discover in it some traces of an acid or alkaline ingredient, which might
confer upon it medicinal activity. The fatal errors into which such an
hypothesis was liable to betray the practitioner, receive an awful illustration
in the history of the memorable fever that raged at Leyden in the
year 1699, and which consigned two thirds of the population of that city
to an untimely grave; an event which, in a great measure, depended upon
the Professor Sylvius de la Boe, who having just embraced the chemical
doctrines of Van Helmont, assigned the origin of the distemper to a prevailing
acid, and declared that its cure could alone be effected by the copious
administration of absorbent and testaceous medicines; an extravagance
into which Van Helmont, himself, would hardly have been betrayed:—but
thus it is in Philosophy, as in Politics, that the partisans of a
popular leader are always more sanguine, and less reasonable, than their
master; they are not only ready to delude the world, but most anxious to
deceive themselves, and while they warmly defend their favourite system
from the attacks of those that may assail it, they willingly close their own
eyes, and conceal from themselves the different points that are untenable;
or, to borrow the figurative language of a French writer, they are like the
pious children of Noah,<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a> who went backwards, that they might not see
the nakedness which they approached for the purpose of covering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unlike the mechanical physicians, the chemists explain the beneficial
operation of iron by supposing that it increases the proportion of red globules
in the blood, on the erroneous<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a> hypothesis that iron constitutes the
principal element of these bodies. Thus has iron, from its acknowledged
powers, been enlisted into the service of every prevailing hypothesis; and
it is not a little singular, as a late writer has justly observed, that theories
however different, and even adverse, do nevertheless often coincide in matters
of practice, as well with each other as with long established empirical
usages, each bending as it were, and conforming, in order to do homage to
truth and experience. And yet iron, whose medicinal virtues have been
so generally allowed, has not escaped those vicissitudes in reputation which
almost every valuable remedy has been doomed to suffer: at one period
the ancients imagined that wounds inflicted by iron instruments, were never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>disposed to heal, for which reason Porsenna, after the expulsion of the
Tarquins, actually stipulated with the Romans that they should not use
iron, except in agriculture; and Avicenna was so alarmed at the idea of
its internal use as a remedy, when given in substance, that he seriously
advised the exhibition of a magnet<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c015'><sup>[43]</sup></a> after it to prevent any direful consequences.
The fame even of Peruvian bark has been occasionally obscured
by the clouds of false theory some condemned its use altogether,
“because it did not evacuate the morbific matter,” others, “because it
bred obstructions in the viscera,” others again, “because it only bound
up the spirits, and stopped the paroxysms for a time, and favoured the
translation of the peccant matter into the more noble parts.” Thus we
learn from Morton,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a> that Oliver Cromwell fell a victim to an intermittent
fever, because the Physicians were too timid to make a trial of the bark.
It was sold first by the Jesuits for its weight in silver;<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a> and Condamine
relates that in 1690, about thirty years afterwards, several thousand pounds
of it lay at Piura and Payta for want of a purchaser.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor has Sugar escaped the venom of fanciful hypothesis. Dr. Willis
raised a popular outcry against its domestic use, declaring that “it contained
within its particles a secret acid—a dangerous sharpness,—which
caused scurvys, consumptions, and other dreadful diseases.”<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Although I profess to offer merely a few illustrations of those doctrines,
whose perverted applications have influenced the history of the Materia
Medica, I cannot pass over in silence that of John Brown, “the child of
genius and misfortune.” As he generalized diseases, and brought all
within the compass of two grand classes, those of <em>increased</em> and <em>diminished</em>
excitement, so did he abridge our remedies, maintaining, that every agent
which could operate on the human body was a <em>Stimulant</em>, having an identity
of action, and differing only in the degree of its force; so that, according
to his views, the lancet and the brandy bottle were but the opposite
extremes of one and the same class: the mischievous tendency of such a
doctrine is too obvious to require a comment.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the most absurd and preposterous hypothesis that has disgraced
the annals of medicine, and bestowed medicinal reputation upon substances
of no intrinsic worth, is that of the <span class='sc'>Doctrine of Signatures</span>, as it has
been called, which is no less than a belief that <em>every natural substance
which possesses any medicinal virtue, indicates by an obvious and well-marked
external character, the disease for which it is a remedy, or the object for which
it should be employed</em>!<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a> This extraordinary monster of the fancy has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>principally adopted and cherished by Paracelsus, Baptista Porta, and
Crollius, although traces of its existence may be certainly discovered in
very ancient authors. The root of the <em>Mandrake</em>, from its supposed resemblance
to the human form, was esteemed as a remedy for Sterility:
thus did Rachael demand from her sister the Mandrakes (<em>Dudaim</em>) which
Reuben had gathered in the field; impressed, as it would appear, with a
belief in the efficacy of that plant against barrenness.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a> There would
moreover appear in this case to have been some idea of additional virtue
arising from the person who gathered it, for great stress was laid upon
this circumstance, “<em>my son’s</em> Mandrakes:” such a notion is by no means
uncommon in the history of charms. The supposed virtues of the <em>Lapis
Ætites</em>, or <em>Eagle stone</em>,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c015'><sup>[49]</sup></a> described by Dioscorides, Ætius and Pliny, who
assert that if tied to the arm it will prevent abortion, and if fixed to the
thigh forward delivery, were, as we learn from ancient authority, solely
suggested by the manner in which the nodule contained within the stone
moves and rattles, whenever it is shaken. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ætites lapis agitatus, sonitum
edit, velut ex altero lapide prægnans.</span></i>” The conceit however did not assume
the importance of a theory until the end of the fourteenth century, at
which period we find several authors engaged in the support of its truth,
and it will not be unamusing to offer a specimen of their sophistry; they
affirm, that since man is the lord of the creation, all other creatures are
designed for his use, and <em>therefore</em>, that their beneficial qualities and excellencies
must be expressed by such characters as can be seen and understood
by every one; and as man discovers his reason by speech, and
brutes their sensations by various sounds, motions, and gestures, so the
vast variety and diversity of figures, colours, and consistencies, observable
in inanimate creatures, is certainly designed for some wise purpose. It
<em>must be</em>, in order to manifest these peculiar qualities and excellencies,
which could not be so effectually done in any other way, not even by
speech, since no language is universal. Thus, the lungs of a fox must
be a specific for asthma, <em>because</em> that animal is remarkable for its strong
powers of respiration. <em>Turmerick</em> has a brilliant yellow colour, which indicates
that it has the power of curing the jaundice; by the same rule,
<em>Poppies</em> must relieve diseases of the head; <em>Agaricus</em> those of the bladder;
<em>Cassia fistula</em> the affections of the intestines, and <em>Aristolochia</em> the disorders
of the uterus: the polished surface and stony hardness which so eminently
characterise the seeds of the <em>Lithospermum Officinale</em> (Common Gromwell)
were deemed a certain indication of their efficacy in calculous and gravelly
disorders; for a similar reason the roots of the <em>Saxifraga Granulata</em> (White
Saxifrage) gained reputation in the cure of the same disease; and the
<em>Euphrasia</em> (Eye-bright) acquired fame, as an application in complaints of
the eye, because it exhibits a black spot in its corolla resembling the
pupil.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the curious work of <em>Chrysostom Magnenus</em>, we meet with a whimsical
account of the <em>Signature</em> of Tobacco. “In the first place,” says he,
“the manner in which the flowers adhere to the head of the plant indicates
the <em>Infundibulum Cerebri</em>, and <em>Pituitary Gland</em>. In the next place,
the three membranes of which its leaves are composed announce their
value to the stomach which has three membranes.”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>The blood-stone, the <em>Heliotropium</em> of the ancients, from the occasional
small specks or points of a blood red colour exhibited on its green surface,
is even at this day employed in many parts of England and Scotland, to
stop a bleeding from the nose; and nettle-tea continues a popular remedy
for the cure of <em>Urticaria</em>. It is also asserted that some substances
bear the <span class='sc'>Signatures</span> of the humours, as the petals of the red rose that
of the blood, and the roots of rhubarb and the flowers of saffron, that of
the bile.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>I apprehend that John of Gaddesden, in the fourteenth century, celebrated
by Chaucer, must have been directed by some remote analogy of
this kind, when he ordered the son of Edward the First, who was dangerously
ill with the small-pox, to be wrapped in scarlet cloth, as well as
all those who attended upon him, or came into his presence, and even the
bed and room in which he was laid were covered with the same drapery;
and so completely did it answer, say the credulous historians of that day,
that the Prince was cured without having so much as a single mark left
upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>In enumerating the conceits of Physic, as relating to the Materia Medica,
we must not pass over the idea, so prevalent at one period, that <em>all
poisonous substances possess a powerful and mutual elective attraction for each
other</em>; and that consequently, if a substance of this kind were suspended
around the neck, it would, by intercepting and absorbing every noxious
particle, preserve the body from the virulence of contagious matter. Angelus
Sala, accordingly, gives us a formula for what he terms his <em>Magnes
Arsenicalis</em>, which he asserts will not only defend the body from the influence
of poison, but will, from its powers of attraction, draw out the venom
from an infected person. In the celebrated plague of London, we are
informed that amulets of arsenic were upon this principle suspended over
the region of the heart, as a preservative against infection.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is yet to be mentioned another absurd conceit which long existed
respecting the subject of Antidotes,—a belief that every natural poison
carried within itself its own antidote; thus we learn from the writings
of Dioscorides, Galen, and Pliny, that the <em>virus</em> of the <em>Cantharis Vesicatoria</em>
existed in the body of the fly, and that the head, feet, and wings,
contained its antidote; for the same potent reason were the hairs of the
rabid dog esteemed the true specific for Hydrophobia.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c015'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'>DEVOTION TO AUTHORITY, AND ESTABLISHED ROUTINE.</h3>

<p class='c018'>This has always been the means of opposing the progress of reason—the
advancement of natural truths—and the prosecution of new discoveries;
whilst, with effects no less baneful, has it perpetuated many of the
stupendous errors which have been already enumerated, as well as others
no less weighty, and which are reserved for future discussion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>To give general currency to an hypothetical opinion, or medicinal reputation
to an inert substance, requires only the talismanic aid of a few
great names; when once established upon such a basis, ingenuity, argument,
and even experiment, may open their ineffectual batteries. The
laconic sentiment of the Roman Satirist is ever opposed to our remonstrance—“Marcus
dixit?—ita est.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Did Marcus say ’twas fact? then fact it is,</div>
      <div class='line'>No proof so valid as a word of his.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>A physician cannot err, in the opinion of the public, if he implicitly obeys
the dogmas of authority; in the most barbarous ages of ancient Egypt,
he was punished or rewarded according to the extent of his success, but
to escape the former, it was only necessary to shew that an orthodox plan
of cure had been followed, such as was prescribed in the acknowledged
writings of Hermes. It is an instinct in our nature to follow the track
pointed out by a few leaders; we are gregarious animals, in a moral as
well as a physical sense, and we are addicted to routine, because it is always
easier to follow the opinions of others than to reason and judge for
ourselves. “The mass of mankind,” as Dr. Paley observes, “act more
from habit than reflection.” What, but such a temper could have upheld
the preposterous system of Galen for more than thirteen centuries; and
have enabled it to give universal laws in medicine to Europe—Africa—and
part of Asia?<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c015'><sup>[53]</sup></a> What, but authority, could have inspired a general
belief, that the sooty washings of rosin<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c015'><sup>[54]</sup></a> would act as an universal remedy?
What, but a blind devotion to authority, or an insuperable attachment
to established custom and routine, could have so long preserved from
oblivion the absurd medicines which abound in our earlier dispensatories?
for example, the “<em>Decoctum ad Ictericos</em>,” of the Edinburgh College,
which never had any other foundation than the doctrine of signatures, in
favour of the <em>Curcuma</em> and <em>Chelidonium Majus</em>;<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c015'><sup>[55]</sup></a> and it is only within a
few years, that the <em>Theriaca Andromachi</em>, in its ancient absurd form, has
been dismissed from the British Pharmocopœia.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c015'><sup>[56]</sup></a> The <span class='sc'>Codex-Medicamentarius</span>
of Paris, recently edited, still cherishes this many-headed<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c015'><sup>[57]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>monster of pharmacy, in all its pristine deformity, under the appropriate
title of “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Electuarium Opiatum Polupharmacum</span></cite>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, however, evidently indebted for this unexpected rescue from oblivion
to a cause very remote from that which may be at first imagined;
not from any belief in its powers or reliance upon its efficacy, but from a
disinclination to oppose the torrent of popular prejudice, and to reject what
has been established by authority and sanctioned by time. For the
same reason, and in violation of their better judgment, the editors have
retained the absurd formula of Diest for the preparation of an extract of
opium; which, after directing various successive operations, concludes
by ordering the decoction to be boiled incessantly for six months, supplying
the waste of water at intervals! Many of the compound formulæ in
this new <span class='sc'>Codex</span>, it is frankly allowed, possess an unnecessary and unmeaning,
if not an injurious complexity; and yet, such force has habit,
and so paramount are the <em>verba magistri</em>, that the editors are satisfied in
distinguishing the more important ingredients by printing them in <em>Italics</em>,
leaving the rest to be supplied at the whim and caprice of the dispenser,
and thus are the grand objects and use of a national Pharmacopœia defeated,
which should above all things insure uniformity in the strength and
composition of its officinal preparations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same devotion to authority which induces us to retain an accustomed
remedy for pertinacity, will always oppose the introduction of a
novel practice with asperity, unless indeed it be supported by authority
of still greater weight and consideration. The history of various articles
of diet and medicine will prove in a striking manner, how greatly
their reputation and fate have depended upon authority. It was not until
many years after <em>Ipecacuan</em><a id='t28'></a> had been imported into Europe, that Helvetius,
under the patronage of Louis XIV. succeeded in introducing it into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>practice: and to the eulogy of Katharine, queen of Charles II. we are
indebted for the general introduction of Tea into England.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c015'><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>That most extraordinary plant,<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a> <em>Tobacco</em>, notwithstanding its powers
of fascination, has suffered romantic vicissitudes in its fame and character;
it has been successively opposed, and commended by physicians—condemned,
and eulogised by priests and kings—and proscribed, and protected
by governments; whilst at length this once insignificant production
of a little island, or an obscure district, has succeeded in diffusing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>itself through every climate, and in subjecting the inhabitants of every
country to its dominion. The Arab cultivates it in the burning desert—The
Laplander and Esquimaux risk their lives to procure a refreshment
so delicious in their wintry solitude—the Seaman, grant him but this luxury,
and he will endure with cheerfulness every other privation, and defy
the fury of the raging elements; and in the higher walks of civilized
society, at the shrine of fashion, in the palace, and in the cottage, the
fascinating influence of this singular plant commands an equal tribute of
devotion and attachment. The history of the Potatoe is perhaps not
less extraordinary, and is strikingly illustrative of the omnipotent influence
of authority; the introduction of this valuable plant received, for
more than two centuries, an unexampled opposition from vulgar prejudice,
which all the philosophy of the age was unable to dissipate, until
Louis the XVth wore a bunch of the flowers of the potatoe in the midst
of his court, on a day of festivity; the people then for the first time obsequiously
acknowledged its utility, and ventured to express their astonishment
at the apathy which had so long prevailed with regard to its
general cultivation; that which authority thus established, time and experience
have fully ratified, and scientific research has extended the numerous
resources which this plant is so wonderfully calculated to furnish;
thus, its stalk, considered as a textile plant, produces in Austria a cottony
flax—in Sweden, sugar is extracted from its root—by combustion its
different parts yield a very considerable quantity of potass,—its apples,
when ripe, ferment and yield vinegar by exposure, or spirit by distillation—its
tubercles made into a pulp, are a substitute for soap in bleaching,—cooked
by steam, the potatoe is the most wholesome and nutritious,
and, at the same time, the most economical of all vegetable aliments.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c015'><sup>[60]</sup></a>—by
different manipulations it furnishes two kinds of flour, a gruel, and
a parenchyma, which in times of scarcity may be made into bread, or
applied to increase the bulk of bread made from grain,—to the invalid
it furnishes both aliment and medicine; its starch is not in the least inferior
to the Indian arrow root, and Dr. Latham has lately shown that an
extract may be prepared from its leaves and flowers, which possesses valuable
properties as an anodyne remedy.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c015'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The history of the warm bath<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c015'><sup>[62]</sup></a> presents us with another curious instance
of the vicissitudes to which the reputation of our valuable resources
are so universally exposed; that which for so many ages was esteemed
the greatest luxury in health,<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a> and the most efficacious remedy
in disease, fell into total disrepute in the reign of Augustus, for no other
reason than because Antonius Musa had cured the Emperor of a dangerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>malady by the use of the <em>cold</em> bath. The most frigid water that could
be procured was, in consequence, recommended on every occasion: thus
Horace, in his epistle to Vala, exclaims—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">——Caput ac stomachum supponere fontibus audent.</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clusinis, gabiosque petunt, et frigida rura.</span>”—<em>Epist.</em> xv. <em>Lib.</em> 1.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This practice, however, was doomed but to an ephemeral popularity,
for although it had restored the Emperor to health, it shortly afterwards
killed his nephew and son in law, Marcellus; an event which at once deprived
the remedy of its credit, and the physician of his popularity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of the Peruvian Bark would furnish a very curious illustration
of the overbearing influence of authority in giving celebrity to a
medicine, or in depriving it of that reputation to which its virtues entitle it.
This heroic remedy was first brought to Spain in the year 1632, and we
learn from Villerobel that it remained for seven years in that country before
any trial was made of its powers, a certain ecclesiastic of Alcala being
the first person in Spain to whom it was administered in the year 1639;
but even at this period its use was limited, and it would have sunk into
oblivion but for the supreme power of the Roman church, by whose auspices
it was enabled to gain a temporary triumph over the passions and prejudices
which opposed its introduction; Innocent the Tenth, at the intercession
of Cardinal de Lugo, who was formerly a Spanish Jesuit, ordered that
the nature and effects of it should be duly examined, and upon being reported
as both innocent and salutary, it immediately rose into public notice;<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c015'><sup>[64]</sup></a>
its career, however, was suddenly stopped by its having unfortunately
failed in the autumn of 1652 to cure Leopold, Archduke of Austria,
of a Quartan Intermittent; this disappointment kindled the resentment of
the prince’s principal physician, Chifletius, who published a violent philippic
against the virtues of Peruvian Bark, which so fomented the prejudices
against its use, that it had nearly fallen into total neglect and disrepute.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus there exists a fashion in medicine, as in the other affairs of life,
regulated by the caprice and supported by the authority of a few leading
practitioners, which has been frequently the occasion of dismissing from
practice valuable medicines, and of substituting others less certain in their
effects and more questionable in their nature. As years and fashions revolve,
so have these neglected remedies, each in its turn, risen again into
favour and notice, whilst old receipts, like old almanacks, are abandoned
until the period may arrive, that will once more adapt them to the spirit
and fashion of the times. Thus it happens that most of our “<em>New Discoveries</em>”
in the Materia Medica have turned out to be no more than the
revival and adaptation of ancient practices. In the last century, the root
of the <em>Aspidium Filix</em>, the Male Fern, was retailed as a secret nostrum by
Madame Nouffleur, a French empiric, for the cure of tape worm; the secret
was purchased for a considerable sum of money by Louis XV. and
the physicians then discovered that the same remedy had been administered
in that complaint by Galen.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c015'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>The history of popular medicines for the cure of Gout, will also furnish
us with ample matter for the illustration of this subject. The celebrated
Duke of Portland’s Powder was no other than the <em>Diacentaureon</em> of Cælius
Aurelianus, or the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antidotos ex duobus Centaureæ generibus</span></i> of Ætius,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c015'><sup>[66]</sup></a> the
receipt for which a friend of his Grace brought from Switzerland; into
which country it had been probably introduced by the early medical writers,
who had transcribed its virtues from the Greek volumes soon after
their arrival into the western parts of Europe. The active ingredient of a
no less celebrated remedy for the same disease, <em>the Eau Medicinale</em>,<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c015'><sup>[67]</sup></a> has
been discovered to be the <em>Colchicum Autumnale</em> or Meadow Saffron; upon
investigating the properties of this medicine, it was observed that similar
effects in the cure of the gout were ascribed to a certain plant, called <em>Hermodactyllus</em><a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c015'><sup>[68]</sup></a>
by Oribasius and Ætius, but more particularly by Alexander
of Tralles,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c015'><sup>[69]</sup></a> a physician of Asia Minor in the fourth century; an inquiry
was accordingly instituted after this unknown plant, and upon procuring
a specimen of it from Constantinople, it was actually found to be a species
of <em>Colchicum</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The use of Prussic acid in the cure of Phthisis, which has been lately
proposed by Dr. Majendie, and introduced into the <cite>Codex Medicamentarius</cite>
of Paris, is little else than the revival of the Dutch practice in this complaint;
for Linnæus informs us, in the fourth volume of his “<cite>Amænitates
Academicæ</cite>,” that distilled Laurel water was frequently used in Holland for
the cure of pulmonary consumption.</p>

<p class='c007'>The celebrated fever powder of Dr. James was evidently not his original
composition, but an Italian nostrum invented by a person of the name
of Lisle, a receipt for the preparation of which is to be found at length in
<cite>Colborne’s Complete English Dispensatory for the year 1756</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The various secret preparations of Opium, which have been extolled
as the invention of modern times, may be recognized in the works of ancient
authors; for instance, Wedelius in his <em>Opiologia</em> describes an acetic
solution; and the <em>Magisterium</em> of Ludovicus, as noticed by Etmuller,
was a preparation made by dissolving Opium in vinegar, and precipitating
with Salt of Tartar;<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c015'><sup>[70]</sup></a> Van Helmont recommends a preparation, similar
to the black drop, under the title of <em>Laudanum Cydoniatum:</em> then again
we have Langelott’s Laudanum, and Le Mort’s “<em>Extract out of Rain
water</em>,” preparations which owe their mildness to the abstraction of the
resinous element of opium.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>The works of Glauber contain accounts of many discoveries that have
been claimed by the chemists of our own day; he recommends the use of
muriatic acid in sea scurvy, and describes an apparatus for its preparation
exactly similar to that which has been extolled as the invention of Wolff;
he also notices the production of <em>Pyro-acetic Acid</em>, under the title of “<em>Vinegar
of Wood</em>,” so that the fact of the identity of this acid and Vinegar,
so lately announced by Vauquelin as a <em>New Discovery</em>, was evidently
known to Glauber nearly two centuries ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have within the last few years heard much of the efficacy of Henbane
fumigations in the tooth-ache, an application which may be easily
shewn to be the revival only of a very ancient practice.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c015'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But while we might thus proceed to annul many other claims for originality,
we ought not to close our eyes to the fallacies to which such investigations
are peculiarly exposed. Nothing is more easy than to invest
the doubtful sentence of an obscure author with an interpretation best
adapted for the support of a favourite theory, and instances might be adduced
where the medical antiquarian<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c015'><sup>[72]</sup></a> has by violence and distortion
forced the most contradictory passages into his service; treating, in short,
the oracles of Physic just as Lord Peter treated his father’s will in the
<em>Tale of a Tub</em>,—determined to discover the word “<em>Shoulder Knots</em>,” he
picks it out, letter by letter, and is even at last obliged to substitute <span class='fss'>C</span>
for <span class='fss'>K</span> in the orthography.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor has Fashion confined her baneful interference to the selection of remedies;
she has ventured even to decide upon the nature of Diseases,
and to change and modify their appellations according to the whim and
caprice by which she is governed. The Princess, afterwards Queen
Anne, was subject to Hypochondriacal attacks, which her Physicians
pronounced to be <em>Spleen</em>, <em>Vapours</em>, or <em>Hyp</em>, and recommended Rawleigh’s
Confection, and Pearl Cordial, for its cure: this circumstance was sufficient
to render both the Disease and Remedy <em>fashionable</em>; no other complaint
was ever heard of in the precincts of the court but that of the <em>Vapours</em>,
nor any medicine esteemed but that of Rawleigh. Some years afterwards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>in consequence of Dr. Whytt’s publication on “<em>Nervous diseases</em>,”
a lady of Fashion was pronounced to be <em>Nervous</em>—the term became
general, and the disease <em>fashionable</em>; and <em>Spleen</em>, <em>Vapours</em>, and <em>Hyp</em>
were consigned to oblivion: the reign of Nervous Diseases, however, did
not long continue, for a popular work appeared on Biliary Concretions,
and all the world became <em>bilious</em>. We have not patience to pursue the
history of these follies; a transient glance at the ephemeral productions of
the last twenty years would furnish a sad display of the versatility of medical
opinions, and of the instability of the practice which has been founded
upon them: and they will no doubt furnish the future historian with
strong and forcible illustrations.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>THE ASSIGNING TO ART THAT WHICH WAS THE EFFECT OF UNASSISTED NATURE, OR THE CONSEQUENCE OF INCIDENTAL CHANGES OF HABIT, DIET, &amp;c.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Our inability upon all occasions to appreciate the efforts of nature in
the cure of disease, must always render our notions, with respect to the
powers of art, liable to numerous errors and multiplied deceptions. Nothing
is more natural, and at the same time more erroneous, than to attribute
the cure of a disease to the last medicine that had been employed; the advocates
of amulets and charms<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c015'><sup>[73]</sup></a> have even been thus enabled to appeal to
the testimony of what they call experience, in justification of their superstitions;
and cases which, in truth and justice, ought to be considered
most lucky escapes, have been triumphantly pronounced as skilful cures;
and thus have medicines and practitioners alike acquired unmerited praise,
or unjust censure. Upon Mrs. Stephens offering her remedy for the stone
to Parliament,<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c015'><sup>[74]</sup></a> a committee of professional men was nominated to ascertain
its efficacy; a patient with stone was selected, and he took the remedy;
his sufferings were soon relieved, and upon examining the bladder
in the usual way, no stone could be felt, it was therefore agreed that the
patient had been cured, and that the stone had been dissolved; some time
afterwards this patient died, and on being opened, a large stone was found
in a pouch, formed by a part of the bladder, and which communicated with
it. When the yellow fever raged in America, the practitioners trusted
exclusively to the copious use of mercury; at first, this plan was deemed
so universally efficacious, that in the enthusiasm of the moment, it was
triumphantly proclaimed that death never took place after the mercury
had evinced its effect upon the system: all this was very true, but it furnished
no proof of the efficacy of that metal, since the disease, in its aggravated
form, was so rapid in its career, that it swept away its victims
long before the system could be brought under mercurial influence, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>in its milder shape it passed off equally well without any assistance from
art.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us then, before we decree the honours of a cure to a favourite medicine,
carefully and candidly ascertain the exact circumstances under
which it was exhibited, or we shall rapidly accumulate examples of the
fallacies to which our art is exposed; what has been more common than
to attribute to the efficacy of a mineral water, those fortunate changes of
constitution that have entirely or in great measure, arisen from salubrity
of situation, hilarity of mind, exercise of body, and regularity of habits,
which have incidentally accompanied its potation. Thus, the celebrated
John Wesley, while he commemorates the triumph of ‘Sulphur and Supplication’
over his bodily infirmity, forgets to appreciate the resuscitating
influence of four months repose from his apostolic labours; and such is
the disposition of the human mind to place confidence in the operation of
mysterious agents, that we find him more disposed to attribute his cure to
a brown paper plaister of egg and brimstone, than to Dr. Fothergill’s salutary
prescription of country air, rest, asses milk, and horse exercise.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c015'><sup>[75]</sup></a>
The ancient physicians duly appreciated the influence of such agents;
their temples, like our watering places, were the resort of those whom
medicine could not cure, and we are expressly told by Plutarch that these
temples, especially that of Esculapius, were erected on elevated spots,
with the most congenial aspects; a circumstance which, when aided by
the invigorating effects of hope, by the diversions which the patient experienced
in his journey, and perhaps by the exercise to which he had been
unaccustomed, certainly performed many cures. It follows then that in
the recommendation of a <em>watering place</em>, something more than the composition
of a mineral spring is to direct our choice,—the chemist will tell us,
that the springs of Hampstead and Islington rival those of Tunbridge and
Malvern, that the waters of Bagnigge Wells, as a chalybeate purgative,
might supersede those of Cheltenham and Scarborough, and that an invalid
would frequent the spring in the vicinity of the Dog and Duck, in
St. George’s Fields, with as much advantage as the celebrated Spa at
Leamington; but the physician is well aware that by the adoption of such
advice, he would deprive his patient of those most powerful auxiliaries to
which I have alluded, and above all, lose the advantages of the “<em>Medicina
Mentis</em>.” On the other hand, the recommendation of change of air
and habits will rarely inspire confidence, unless it be associated with some
medicinal treatment; a truth which it is more easy and satisfactory to
elucidate and enforce by examples than by precept—let the following
story by Voltaire serve as an illustration.—“Ogul, a voluptuary who
could be managed but with difficulty by his physician, on finding himself
extremely ill from indolence and intemperance, requested advice:—‘Eat
a Basilisk, stewed in rose-water,’ replied the physician. In vain did the
slaves search for a <em>Basilisk</em>, until they met with Zadig, who, approaching
Ogul, exclaimed, ‘Behold that which thou desirest;’ ‘but, my Lord,’
continued he, ‘it is not to be eaten; all its virtues must enter through thy
pores, I have therefore enclosed it in a little ball, blown up, and covered
with a fine skin; thou must strike this ball with all thy might, and I must
strike it back again, for a considerable time, and by observing this regimen,
and taking no other drink than rose-water for a few days, thou wilt see,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>and acknowledge the effect of my art.’ The first day Ogul was out of
breath, and thought he should have died from fatigue; the second he was
less fatigued, and slept better: in eight days he recovered all his strength;
Zadig then said to him, ‘There is no such thing in nature as a Basilisk!
but <em>thou hast taken exercise and been temperate, and hast therefore recovered thy
health</em>!’ But the medical practitioner may perhaps receive more satisfaction
from a modern illustration; if so, the following anecdote, related by
Sydenham, may not be unacceptable. This great physician having long
attended a gentleman of fortune with little or no advantage, frankly
avowed his inability to render him any farther service, adding at the same
time, that there was a physician of the name of Robinson, at Inverness,
who had distinguished himself by the performance of many remarkable
cures of the same complaint as that under which his patient laboured,
and expressing a conviction that, if he applied to him, he would come
back cured. This was too encouraging a proposal to be rejected; the
gentleman received from Sydenham a statement of his case, with the
necessary letter of introduction, and proceeded without delay to the place
in question. On arriving at Inverness, and anxiously enquiring for the
residence of Dr. Robinson, he found to his utter dismay and disappointment,
that there was no physician of that name, nor ever had been in
the memory of any person there. The gentleman returned, vowing
eternal hostility to the peace of Sydenham; and on his arrival at home,
instantly expressed his indignation at having been sent on a journey of
so many hundred miles for no purpose. “Well,” replies Sydenham,
“are you better in health?”—“Yes, I am now quite well, but no thanks
to you,”—“No,” says Sydenham, “but you may thank Dr. Robinson
for curing you. I wished to send you a journey with some object of interest
in view; I knew it would be of service to you; in going you had
Dr. Robinson and his wonderful cures in contemplation; and in returning,
you were equally engaged in thinking of scolding me.”</p>

<h3 class='c017'>AMBIGUITY OF NOMENCLATURE.</h3>

<p class='c018'>It has been already stated that we are to a great degree ignorant of the
Simples used by the ancient Physicians; we are often quite unable to determine
what the plants are of which Dioscorides treats. It does not appear
that out of the 700 plants of which his Materia Medica consists,
that more than 400 are correctly ascertained; and yet no labour has been
spared to clear the subject of its difficulties; Cullen even laments that
so much pains should have been bestowed upon so barren an occasion.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c015'><sup>[76]</sup></a>
The early history of botany presents us with such a chaos of nomenclature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>that it must have been impossible for the herbarist and physician to
have communicated their mutual lights; every one was occupied with
disputes upon words and names, and every useful inquiry was suspended,
from an inability to decide what plant each author intended; thus, for
instance, the <em>Herba Britannica</em> of Dioscorides and Pliny, so celebrated for
the cure of the soldiers of Julius Cæsar on the Rhine, of a disease called
‘<em>Scelotyrbe</em>’, and supposed to resemble our sea scurvy, remains quite unknown,
notwithstanding the labours of our most intelligent commentators.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c015'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
It seems also very doubtful whether the plant which we denominate <em>Hemlock</em>
was the poison usually administered at the Athenian executions,<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c015'><sup>[78]</sup></a>
and which deprived Socrates and Phocion of life. Pliny informs us that
the word <em>Cicuta</em>, amongst the ancients, was not indicative of any particular
species of plant, but of vegetable poisons in general; this is a circumstance
to which I am particularly anxious to fix your attention; it is
by no means uncommon to find a word which is used to express general
characters, subsequently become the name of a specific substance in
which such characters are predominant; and we shall find that some important
anomalies in nomenclature may be thus explained. The term
‘<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Αρσενικον,</span>’ from which the word <em>Arsenic</em> is derived, was an ancient epithet,
applied to those natural substances which possessed strong and
acrimonious properties, and as the poisonous quality of arsenic was found
to be remarkably powerful, the term was especially applied to Orpiment,
the form in which this metal more usually occurred. So the term <em>Verbena</em>
(quasi <em>Hebena</em>) originally denoted <em>all those</em> herbs that were held sacred
on account of their being employed in the rites of sacrifice, as we
learn from the poets;<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c015'><sup>[79]</sup></a> but as <em>one</em> herb was usually adopted upon these
occasions, the word <em>Verbena</em> came to denote that particular herb <em>only</em>, and
it is transmitted to us to this day under the same title, viz. <em>Verbena</em>, or
<em>Vervain</em>, and indeed until lately it enjoyed the medical reputation which
its sacred origin conferred upon it, for it was worn suspended around the
neck as an amulet. <em>Vitriol</em>, in the original application of the word, denoted
<em>any</em> crystalline body with a certain degree of transparency (<em>Vitrum</em>);
it is hardly necessary to observe that the term is now appropriated to a
particular species: in the same manner, <em>Bark</em>, which is a general term, is
applied to express <em>one</em> genus, and by way of eminence, it has the article,
<em>The</em>, prefixed, as <em>The</em> Bark: the same observation will apply to the word
<em>Opium</em>, which in its primitive sense signifies <em>any</em> juice (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οπος</span> <em>Succus</em>) while
it now only denotes <em>one</em> species, viz. that of the Poppy. So again, <em>Elaterium</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>was used by Hippocrates, to signify various internal applications,
especially purgatives of a violent and drastic nature (from the word
‘<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ελαυνω</span>,’ <em>agito</em>, <em>moveo</em>, <em>stimulo</em>), but by succeeding authors it was <em>exclusively</em>
applied to denote the active matter which subsides from the juice of
the <em>wild cucumber</em>. The word <em>Fecula</em>, again, originally meant to imply
<em>any</em> substance which was derived by spontaneous subsidence from a liquid,
(from <em>fæx</em>, the grounds or settlement of <em>any</em> liquor); afterwards it
was applied to <em>Starch</em>, which is deposited in this manner by agitating the
flour of wheat in water; and lastly, it has been applied to a peculiar vegetable
principle, which like <em>starch</em><a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c015'><sup>[80]</sup></a> is insoluble in cold, but completely
soluble in boiling water, with which it forms a gelatinous solution; this
indefinite meaning of the word <em>fecula</em> has created numerous mistakes in
pharmaceutic chemistry; Elaterium, for instance, is said to be a <em>fecula</em>,
and in the original sense of the word it is properly so called, inasmuch
as it is procured from a vegetable juice by spontaneous subsidence, but in
the limited and modern acceptation of the term, it conveys an erroneous
idea; for instead of the active principle of the juice residing in <em>fecula</em>, it is
a peculiar proximate principle, <em>sui generis</em>, to which I have ventured to
bestow the name of <em>Elatin</em>. For the same reason, much doubt and obscurity
involve the meaning of the word <em>Extract</em>, because it is applied <em>generally</em>
to any substance obtained by the evaporation of a vegetable solution,
and <em>specifically</em> to a peculiar proximate principle, possessed of certain
characters, by which it is distinguished from every other elementary body—See
<em>Extracta</em>. On the other hand, we find that many words which
were originally only used to denote particular substances, have, at length,
become subservient to the expression of General Characters; thus the
term <em>Alkali</em>, in its originally sense, signified that particular residuum which
was alone obtained by lixiviating the ashes of the plant named <em>Kali</em>, but
the word is now so generalized that it denotes <em>any</em> body possessed of a
certain number of definite properties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another source of botanical ambiguity and error is the circumstance of
certain plants having acquired the names of others very different in their
nature, but which were supposed to possess a similarity in external character;
thus our <span class='sc'>Potatoe</span>,<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c015'><sup>[81]</sup></a> (<em>Solanum Tuberosum</em>) when it was first imported
into England by the colonists in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
gained its appellation from its supposed resemblance to an esculent vegetable
at that time in common use, under the name of the Sweet Potatoe
(<em>Convolvulus Battatas</em>,) and which, like <em>Eringo Root</em>, had the reputation of
being able to restore decayed vigour, thus Falstaff—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let the sky rain Potatoes, hail kissing Comfits, and snow Eringoes.”</div>
      <div class='line in38'><cite>Merry Wives of Windsor, Act 5, Scene 5.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A similar instance is presented to us in the culinary vegetable well
known under the name of the <span class='sc'>Jerusalem Artichoke</span>, which derived its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>appellation in consequence of its flavour having been considered like that
of the common artichoke; it is hardly necessary to observe that it has no
botanic relation whatever to such a plant, it being an Heliotrope (<em>Heliotropium
Tuberosum</em>), the epithet <em>Jerusalem</em> is a curious corruption of the Italian
term <em>Gira-Sole</em>, that is, <em>turn-sun</em>, in English, or <em>Heliotrope</em> in Greek.
This instance of verbal corruption is not solitary in medical botany; <span class='sc'>Castor
Oil</span> will suggest itself as another example; this oil, from its supposed
efficacy in curing and assuaging the unnatural heat of the body, and in
soothing the passions, was called by the French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Agnus Castus</span></i>, whence
the inhabitants of St. Kitt’s in the West Indies, who were formerly blended
with the French in that Island, called it <em>Castor</em> oil. In some cases
again, a plant has received a modern name, compounded of two ancient
ones; it appears from Pliny that the <em>Assarum</em> was not uncommonly confounded
with the <em>Baccharis</em>; an English name was accordingly bestowed
upon it, which is a curious compromise of the question, for it is a compound
of both, viz. <em>Assara-bacca</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some instances the most alarming mistakes have occurred from substances
of a very different nature having been mentioned under similar
names, <em>Arsenic</em> for instance, has actually been inhaled,<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c015'><sup>[82]</sup></a> together with the
vapours of Frankincense, Myrrh, and those of other gums, during a
paroxysm of Asthma! a practice which arose from the practitioner having
confounded the Gum Juniper, or <em>Vernix</em> of the Arabians, which was prescribed
for fumigations under the name of <em>Sandarach</em>, with the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σανδαρακη</span>
of Aristotle, and which was a sulpheret of Arsenic. The gum which we
know at the present day under the name of <em>Sanguis Draconis</em>, or <em>Dragon’s
blood</em>, was called by the ancient Greeks <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κινναβαρὶ</span>, a term which has been
incorrectly transferred to a Sulphuret of Mercury, for no other reason than
because this mineral has the same red colour as the gum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The advanced state of <span class='sc'>Botanical Science</span> will now prevent the recurrence
of those doubts and difficulties which have formerly embarrassed
the history of vegetable remedies, by furnishing a strictly philosophical
language, independent of all theory, and founded upon natural structure,
and therefore necessarily beyond the controul of opinion; while the advancement
of chemical knowledge, by enabling us better to distinguish
and identify the different substances we employ, will also materially assist
in preventing the confusion which has formerly oppressed us. At the
same time, I am unwilling to join in the commendations so liberally bestowed
upon our chemical nomenclature; nay, I am disposed to consider
it as a matter of regret that the names of our medicinal compounds should
have any relation to their chemical composition, for in the present unsettled
state of this science, such a language must necessarily convey theory instead
of truth, and opinions rather than facts; in short, it places us at the
mercy and disposal of every new hypothesis, which may lay our boasted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>fabric in ruins, and in its place raise another superstructure, equally frail
in its materials and ephemeral in its duration: thus <span class='sc'>Corrosive Sublimate</span>
was a <em>muriate</em> of Mercury, or an <em>oxy-muriate</em>, until Sir H. Davy established
his new theory of chlorine, and then it became a <em>bi-chloride</em>; at
some future period, Chlorine will be found to be a compound, and then it
must have another name; for the same reason the term <span class='sc'>Calomel</span>,<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c015'><sup>[83]</sup></a> is
surely to be preferred to <em>sub-muriate</em>, or <em>Chloride</em>. <span class='sc'>Tartarized Antimony</span>,
again, has been called by our nomenclatural reformers the <em>Tartrate of
Antimony and Potass</em>; but is it a triple compound? Gay Lussac thinks
not, and considers it as a combination, in which <em>Cream of Tartar</em> acts the
part of a simple acid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again,—we have only to revert to the nomenclature of the Salts in
our Materia Medica to discover the actual change in meaning which the
same word has undergone in a very few years. It was originally understood
that the term <em>Sub</em>, when prefixed to the generic name of a Salt, indicated
the presence of certain qualities depending upon an excess of
base; but now, forsooth, the term has reference only to atomic composition,
without any regard to qualities.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c015'><sup>[84]</sup></a> That salt alone being acknowledged
as a true <em>Sub</em>-salt, in which there is less than one atom of acid to
each atom of base; thus our “<em>Sub</em>-carbonate of Soda,” is no longer considered
a <em>Sub</em>-salt, for the reason above stated; and notwithstanding the
predominance of its alkaline characters, it is known to chemists by the appellation
of <em>Carbonate</em> of soda. It is far from my intention to question the
propriety of these changes, I only maintain that, amidst such chemical
doubts, the Pharmaceutist is the last person who should become arbiter;
let him await the issue in unobtrusive silence, and take care that the language
of Pharmacy partakes of the same neutrality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such was the feeling of the Committee appointed by the College for
the revision of the late London Pharmacopœia, and it sufficiently explains
why the nomenclature of the alkaline salts has been left unchanged in
the present edition of that work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The French, in their new <em>Codex</em>, are absurdly extravagant in their application
of chemical nomenclature; thus, the sub-carbonate of potass is
called by them <em>sub-deuto-carbonas potassii</em>. The first part of this quadruple
name indicates the comparative quantity of acid in the salt, the second
that of oxygen contained in the base, the thud announces the acid,
and the fourth the basis of the base!</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>THE PROGRESS OF BOTANICAL SCIENCE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>It has been just stated, that we have derived from botanical science a
philosophical language which enables us to describe the structure and habits
of any plant, with a luminous brevity and an unerring perspicuity;
but we are moreover indebted to botany for another service no less important
to the successful investigation of the Materia Medica,—that of
throwing into well defined groups, those plants which possess obvious natural
affinities, and which will be found at the same time to present certain
medicinal analogies; indeed, as a general rule, we may admit the
axiom, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quæ genere conveniunt, virtute conveniunt</span></i>.”<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c015'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Umbelliferæ</em> which grow on dry ground are aromatic, whilst the
aquatic species are among the most deadly poisons. The <em>Cruciform</em>
plants are aromatic and acrid in their nature, containing essential oils,
(hence the peculiar smell of cabbage-water, &amp;c.) which are obtainable by
distillation; and Linnæus asserts that “among all the <em>Leguminous</em> or <em>Papilionaceous</em>
tribe there is no deleterious plant to be found:” this however is
not exactly true. Some of the individuals in these natural orders, although
very nearly related, do nevertheless possess various, and even opposite
qualities; in the leguminous tribe above mentioned, which is as
consistent as any one we possess, we have the <em>Cytisus Laburnum</em>, the
seeds of which are violently emetic, and those of <em>Lathyrus Sativus</em>, which
have been supposed at Florence to soften the bones and cause death.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the subdivision of a genus there is often a remarkable difference in
the properties of the species; there are, for instance, <em>Solanums</em>, <em>Lettuces</em>,
<em>Cucumbers</em>, and <em>Mushrooms</em>, both esculent and poisonous. The <em>Digitalis</em>
or <em>Foxglove</em>, and the <em>Verbascum</em>, or common <em>Mullein</em> of our fields, are included
in the same Natural family, and yet the one is as active, as the
other is mild in its effects; the plants of the natural family of <em>Contortæ</em>
abound with a highly acrid milky juice, but Dr. Afzelius met with a shrub
of this order at Sierra Leone, the milk of whose fruit was so sweet, as
well as copious, as to be used instead of cream for tea; this is certainly
what no one could have guessed from analogy. The same individual
will vary from culture or other circumstances, as much as any two plants
which have no botanic affinity; the Chamomile, <em>Anthemis Nobilis</em>, with
which we are well acquainted, may have its whole disk changed by cultivation,
to ligulate white florets, destitute of medicinal properties. But,
what is more embarrassing, the different parts of the same plant have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>often very different powers; a fact which is beautifully exemplified in the
<em>Podophyllum Peltatum</em>, or May Apple, the <em>leaves</em> of which are poisonous,
the root powerfully cathartic, and the <em>fruit</em> agreeably esculent; so the
leaves of the <em>Jatropa Manihot</em> are employed as a common esculent, while
its root secretes a most virulent poison; but we need not seek further for
an example than the fruit of the Lemon, the juice of which is <em>acid</em>, its
seeds <em>bitter</em>, and its <em>rind aromatic</em>; in some instances it happens that the
energy of a plant is concentrated in one particular part, and that all the
rest is absolutely inert; thus, the root of the <em>Convolvulus Scammonia</em>, is
the only portion of that plant which possesses any medicinal quality;<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c015'><sup>[86]</sup></a>
and the tree which yields the drastic <em>Camboge</em>, presents at the same time
an esculent fruit, which is eaten by the natives with as much impunity as
the orange; yet, notwithstanding all these difficulties, botany is capable of
furnishing us with analogies which will lead to important conclusions with
respect to the medicinal properties of different vegetables.</p>

<p class='c007'>The system of Linnæus, although in a great degree artificial, corresponds
in a surprising manner with the natural properties of plants; thus
a plant whose <em>calyx</em> is a double valved <em>glume</em>, with three <em>stamina</em>, two <em>pistils</em>,
and one <em>naked seed</em>, bears seeds of a farinaceous and nutritious quality;
a flower with twelve, or more <em>stamina</em>, all of which are inserted in the internal
side of the <em>calyx</em>, will furnish a wholesome fruit; whereas a plant
whose flower has five <em>stamina</em>, one <em>pistil</em>, one <em>petal</em>, and whose fruit is of
the <em>berry</em> kind, may at once be pronounced as poisonous.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is also in a great degree true that the sensible qualities of plants,
such as <em>colour</em>, <em>taste</em>, and <em>smell</em>, have an intimate relation to their properties,
and may often lead by analogy to an indication of their powers; we have
an example of this in the dark and gloomy aspect of the <em>Luridæ</em>, which is
indicative of their narcotic and very dangerous qualities, as <em>Datura</em>, <em>Hyoscyamus</em>,
<em>Atropa</em>, and <em>Nicotiana</em>. <em>Colour</em> is certainly in many cases a test of
activity; the deepest coloured flowers of the <em>Digitalis</em>, for example, are
the most active, and when the leaves of powerful plants lose their green
hue, we may conclude that a corresponding deterioration has taken place
with respect to their virtues; but Linnæus ascribed too much importance
to such an indication, and his aphorisms are unsupported by facts; for
instance, he says “Color pallidus <em>insipidum</em>, viridis <em>crudum</em>, luteus <em>amarum</em>,
ruber <em>acidum</em>, albus <em>dulce</em>, niger <em>ingratum</em>, indicat.”<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c015'><sup>[87]</sup></a> A peculiar heavy
odour, which is well known, but is with difficulty defined, is a sure indication
of narcotic properties. Bitterness, when not extreme, denotes a
tonic quality, which will stimulate the stomach and intestines, and promote
the process of digestion. When the bitterness is more intense and
pungent,<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c015'><sup>[88]</sup></a> as in <em>Aloes</em>, <em>Colocynth</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em> we may infer that such substances
will produce a more active effect upon the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>, and that catharsis
will follow their administration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Botanical, like human physiognomy, may frequently afford an insight
into character, but it is very often a fallacious index. With regard to the
indications of <em>Smell</em> and <em>Taste</em>, it may be observed that in the examination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>of an unknown substance we instinctively apply to these senses for information
respecting its properties. It is certainly reasonable to suppose,
that those bodies which produce upon the organs of taste a sensible, astringent,
or pungent effect, may occasion an impression, corresponding in
degree upon the stomach or intestines, which are but an extension of the
same structure. But what numerous exceptions are there to such a law?
nay, some of the most poisonous substances affect in a very slight degree
the organs of taste, especially those that belong to the mineral kingdom,
as <em>Arsenious Acid</em>, <em>Oxyd of Antimony</em>, <em>Calomel</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em>; yet some of these
are, perhaps, but apparent exceptions, depending upon the degree of solubility
which they possess, in consequence of which their energies are
not developed until they have traversed a considerable portion of mucous
surface. Nor ought it to be forgotten, that cultivation and artificial habits
may have blunted the natural susceptibility of our organs, and in
some instances changed and depraved their functions: certain qualities for
instance are so strongly connected with each other by the chain of association,
that by presenting only one to the mind, the other links follow in
succession.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c015'><sup>[89]</sup></a> It has been remarked, that persons in social life, are more
affected by vegetable odours, while the Savage smells better the putrid
and fœtid exhalations of animal bodies:<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c015'><sup>[90]</sup></a> thus the people of Kamskatcha,
did not smell the perfume of a vegetable Essence (<em>Aqua Melissæ</em>,) but
they discovered by their olfactory sense, a rotten fish, or a stranded whale
at a considerable distance.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c015'><sup>[91]</sup></a> There is no sense more under the dominion
of imagination, or more liable to be perverted by education, than those of
taste and smell; we are also liable to form unjust prejudices from the indications
of colour; for particular colours, from the influence of hidden
associations, are not unfrequently the exciting cause of agreeable or unpleasant
impressions. I have met with a person who regards green food,
if it be of an animal nature, with unconquerable aversion and disgust, indeed
an idea of unwholesomeness has not unfrequently been attached to
this colour, without the least foundation of truth; the bones of the Gar
fish, or Sea Needle, (<em>Esox Helone</em>,) have been deemed unwholesome from
the circumstance of their turning green on being boiled, although not a
single instance can be adduced in which that fish ever occasioned any
harm. I have met with persons who have been made violently sick from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>eating the green part of the oyster;<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c015'><sup>[92]</sup></a> an effect which can have no other
cause than that of unjust prejudice; these examples are sufficient to
shew, with what caution such indications respecting the medicinal qualities
of bodies are to be received.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>THE APPLICATION AND MISAPPLICATION OF CHEMICAL SCIENCE.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Amongst the researches of different authors, who, animated with a
sacred zeal for ancient learning, have endeavoured to establish the antiquity
of chemical science, we find many conclusions deduced from an ingenious
interpretation of the mythological fables<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c015'><sup>[93]</sup></a> which are supposed to
have been transmitted by the Egyptians; who, previous to the invention
of letters, adopted this method of perpetuating their discoveries in natural
philosophy. Thus, wherever Homer studiously describes the stolen embraces
of Mars and Venus, they recognise some chemical secret, some
combination of iron with copper, shadowed in the glowing ornaments of
fiction. Lord Bacon<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c015'><sup>[94]</sup></a> conceived that the union of spirit and matter was
allegorised in the fable of Proserpine being seized by Pluto as she was
gathering flowers; an allusion, says Dr. Darwin, which is rendered more
curiously exact by the late discovery, that pure air, (<em>oxygen</em>) is given out
by vegetables, and that in this state it is greedily absorbed by inflammable
bodies. The same ingenious Poet supposes that the fable of Jupiter and
Juno, by whose union the vernal showers were said to be produced, was
meant to pourtray the production of water by the combination of its two
elements; an opinion which, says he, is strongly supported by the fact
that, in the ancient mythology, the purer air or <em>æther</em>, was always represented
by Jupiter, and the inferior by Juno. Were the elegant author of
the Botanic Garden now living, he would, no doubt, with a taste and delicacy
peculiarly his own, avail himself of the singular discovery of Mr.
Smithson, who has detected in the juice of the mulberry <em>two</em> distinct species
of colouring matter;—the mingled blood of the unfortunate Pyramus
and Thisbe:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Signa tene cædis: pullosque et luctibus aptos</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Semper habe feætus, <em>gemina</em> monumenta cruoris.</span>”</div>
      <div class='line in39'><em>Ovid. Metamorph. Lib.</em> iv. 160.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Sir William Drummond, the learned apologist of Egyptian science,
conceives that the laws of <em>latent</em> heat were even known to the philosophers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>of that ancient nation, and that caloric in such a state, was symbolically
represented by <span class='sc'>Vulcan</span>, while <em>free</em> or <em>sensible</em> caloric was as clearly
described in the character of <span class='sc'>Vesta</span>. Those who maintain the antiquity
of chemistry, and suppose that the fabulous conceptions of the ancients
were but a mysterious veil ingeniously thrown by philosophy between nature
and the lower order of people, consider that the alchemical secret is
metaphorically concealed in the fable of the <span class='sc'>Golden Fleece</span> of the Argonauts,
and reject the more probable solution of this story by Strabo, who
says that the Iberians, near neighbours of the Colchians, used to receive
the gold, brought down from the high lands by the torrents, into sieves
and sheep skins, and that from thence arose the fable of the golden fleece.
Dionysius, of Mytilene, offers a different explanation of the fable, and
supposes it to allude to a book <em>written on skins</em>, and containing an account
of the process of <em>making gold</em> according to the art of alchemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the confidence with which modern philosophers have
claimed the discovery, the experimental mode of investigation was undoubtedly
known and pursued by the ancients, who appear, says <em>Mr.
Leslie</em>,<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c015'><sup>[95]</sup></a> to have concealed their notions respecting it, under the veil of
allegory. <em>Proteus</em> signified the mutable and changing forms of material
objects, and the inquisitive philosopher was counselled by the Poets<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c015'><sup>[96]</sup></a> to
watch their slippery demon when slumbering on the shore, to bind him,
and compel the reluctant captive to reveal his secrets. This, adds Mr.
Leslie, gives a lively picture of the cautious, but intrepid advances of the
skilful experimenter;—he tries to press nature into a corner,—he endeavours
to separate the different principles of action,—he seeks to concentrate
the predominant agent, and labours to exclude, as much as possible,
every disturbing influence.</p>

<p class='c007'>But with whatever ingenuity and success the antiquity of chemical
knowledge may be advocated, as it relates to the various arts of life, yet
it must be allowed that not the most remote trace of its application to
physic can be discovered in the medical writers of Greece or Rome. The
operation of distillation<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c015'><sup>[97]</sup></a> is not even mentioned by Hippocrates or Galen;
and the waters of different plants, as described by some later authors, are
to be understood, as we are informed by Gesner, merely as simple decoctions,
and not as the products of any chemical process; while the Essences
of Dioscorides, Galen, Oribasius, and others, were only the extracts
produced by the evaporation of such infusions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the downfall of the Roman Empire, all the sciences, the arts, and
literature, were overwhelmed in the general wreck, and the early Mahometans,
in the first paroxysms of their fanaticism, endeavoured to destroy
every record of the former progress of the human mind; consigning to
destruction, by the conflagration of the Alexandrian library, no less than
seven hundred thousand volumes, which comprised the most valuable
works of science and literature.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c015'><sup>[98]</sup></a> It is not a little extraordinary that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>same people were destined at a more advanced period, to rekindle the light
of letters,<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c015'><sup>[99]</sup></a> which they had taken such pains to extinguish, and to become
the inventors and cultivators of a new science, boundless in its views, and
inexhaustible in its applications. The medical profession too was more
particularly selected as an object of reward and encouragement; and we
may say, with much truth, that our <em>Materia Medica</em> is more indebted
to the zeal and industry of the Arabians, than to the learning of the
Greeks, or to the refinement of the Romans. From this source we have
acquired the milder purges of <em>Manna</em>, <em>Cassia</em>, <em>Senna</em>, <em>Rhubarb</em>, and many
plants and oriental aromatics, amongst, which we may notice <em>Musk</em>, <em>Nutmeg</em>,
<em>Mace</em>, and <em>Cloves</em>; the introduction of which into medicine was
greatly facilitated by the situation of Bagdat, and its connection with
India; and although Archigenes and Aretæus had long before applied
<em>Blisters</em>, yet it is to the Arabian physicians that we are indebted for a
practical acquaintance with their value, for in general, the Greeks and
Romans prescribed acrid <em>Sinapisms</em> for such a purpose. We are also indebted
to the Arabians for our knowledge respecting Camphor, as its
name imports, for the original word was <em>Cafur</em> or <em>Canfur</em>.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c015'><sup>[100]</sup></a> They are
also the first upon record, who speak of sugar, and sugar-candy, extracted
from the sugar-cane, which they call <em>honey of cane</em>; and they ushered
into practice <em>Syrups</em>, <em>Juleps</em>, and <em>Conserves</em>. At the same time, it is but
just to allow, that from the disgusting ostentation of this people, and their
strong attachment to the marvellous, many absurd medicines have been
introduced. Gold, Silver, Bezoars, and precious stones were received into
their materia medica, and surprising virtues were attributed to them.
Amongst a people thus disposed to magnificence, and from the very spirit
of their religion credulous and romantic, it is not a matter of surprise that
their first researches into the nature of bodies should have raised a hope,
and excited a belief, that the baser metals might be converted into gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>They conceived that gold was the metallic element, in a state of perfect
purity, and that all the other metals differed from it in proportion only
to the extent of their individual contamination, and hence the origin of the
epithet <em>base</em>, as applied to such metals; this hypothesis explains the origin
of alchemy; but, in every history, we are informed that the earlier
alchemists expected, by the same means that they hoped to convert the
<em>baser</em> metals into gold, to produce a universal remedy, calculated to prolong
indefinitely the span of human existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is difficult to imagine what connection could exist in their ideas between
the “<em>Philosopher’s Stone</em>,” which was to transmute metals, and a
remedy which could arrest the progress of bodily infirmity: upon searching
into the writings of these times, it clearly appears that this conceit
originated with the alchemists from the application of false analogies, and
that the error was subsequently diffused and exaggerated by a misconstruction
of alchemical metaphors.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c015'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>An example of reasoning by false analogy is presented to us by Paracelsus,
in his work <em>de vita longa</em>, wherein, speaking of anatomy, he exclaims:
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sicut antimonium finit aurum, sic, eadem ratione et forma, corpus humanum
purum reddit.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>The processes of alchemy were always veiled in the most enigmatic
and obscure language; the earliest alchemist whose name has reached
posterity, is Geber, an Arabian prince of the seventh century, whose language
was so proverbially obscure, that Dr. Johnson supposes the word
gibberish or <em>geberish</em> to have been derived from this circumstance; sometimes
the processes of alchemy were expressed by a figurative and metaphorical
style of description; thus Geber exclaims, “<em>Bring me the six lepers
that I may cleanse them</em>;” by which he implied the conversion of the
six metals,<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c015'><sup>[102]</sup></a> the only ones then known, into gold. From the works of later
alchemists it also appears that they constantly represented <em>gold</em> as a
sound, healthy, and durable man, the imperfect metals as diseased men,
and the means or processes by which the latter were to be transmuted
into the former, they designated by the name of <em>medicines</em>; and hence,
those who were anxious to dive into the secrets of these magicians, or
<b>Adepts</b>, as they termed themselves, without possessing a key to their
language, supposed that these descriptions were to be understood in a literal
sense, and that the imperfect metals might be changed into gold, and
the bodies of sick persons into healthy ones, by one and the same chemical
preparation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hieroglyphical style of writing adopted by the earlier alchemists,
was in a great degree supported by the prevailing idea that the elements
were under the dominion of spiritual beings, who might be submitted to
human power; and Sir Humphry Davy has observed that the notions of
fairies, and of genii, which have been depicted with so much vividness of
fancy and liveliness of description in <span class='sc'>The Thousand and One Nights</span>,
seem to have been connected with the pursuit of the science of transmutation,
and the production of the elixir of life. That the Arabian Nights’
Entertainment admits of a mystic interpretation, is an opinion which I
have long entertained. How strikingly is the effect of fermented spirit, in
banishing the pressure of the melancholy which occurs in solitude, depicted
in the story of Sinbad when he encountered the withered and decrepid
hag, on the uninhabited island—but, to return from this digression to
the subject of medical chemistry.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not in fact until several years had elapsed in the delusive researches
of alchemy, that the application of chemical knowledge became
instrumental in the advancement of the medical art. <span class='sc'>Rhases</span> and <span class='sc'>Avicenna</span>,
who were the celebrated physicians of the age, are the first who
introduced pharmaceutical preparations into their works, or made any improvement
in the mode of conducting pharmaceutical processes. Avicenna
describes, particularly, the method of conducting <em>Distillation</em>; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>mentions also, for the first time, the three <em>Mineral Acids</em>, and distinguishes
between the <em>vegetable</em> and <em>mineral Alkalies</em>; he speaks likewise of
the <em>Distilled Water of Roses</em>, of <em>Sublimed Arsenic</em>, and of <em>Corrosive Sublimate</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1226, <span class='sc'>Roger Bacon</span>, a native of Ilchester in Somersetshire,
and a Franciscan monk of Westminster Abbey, laid the foundations
of chemical science in Europe; his discoveries were so extraordinary that
he was excommunicated by the Pope, and imprisoned ten years for supposed
dealings with the devil; it appears that he was a believer in an universal
Elixir, for he proposed one to Pope Clement the Tenth, which he
extolled highly, as the invention of Petro de Maharncourt.</p>

<p class='c007'>This wonderful man was succeeded at the end of the same century by
Arnoldus de Villa Nova, a Frenchman, or as others assert, a Spaniard,
who deserves to be noticed on this occasion, as being the first to recommend
the distilled spirit of wine, impregnated with certain herbs, as a valuable
remedy; from which we may date the introduction of <em>Tinctures</em> into
medical practice; for, although Thaddæus, a Florentine, who died in
1270, at the age of eighty, bestows great commendation upon the virtues
of <em>Spirit of Wine</em>, yet he never used it as a solvent for active vegetable
matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not however until the end of the thirteenth century, that Chemistry
can be said to have added any considerable power to the arm of
Physic.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Basil Valentine</span>, a German Benedictine monk, led the way to the
internal administration of metallic medicine, by a variety of experiments
on the nature of <em>Antimony</em>, and in his “<em>Currus Triumphalis Antimonii</em>,” a
work written in high Dutch, he has described a number of the combinations
of that metal. If however we may credit a vague tradition, he was
extremely unfortunate in his first experiments upon his brother monks, all
of whom he injured if not killed; those who have keen ears for etymological
sounds will instantly recognise, in this circumstance, the origin of
the word <em>Antimony</em>,—<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁντί Μονοχους</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears that the ancients were ignorant of the internal use and administration
of the metals, with the exception of iron, although they frequently
used them in external applications. Hippocrates recommends
<em>Lead</em> in several parts of his works, as an <em>epulotic</em> application, and for other
external purposes. <em>Litharge of Gold</em> and <em>Cerusse</em> also entered the composition
of several powders extolled by that ancient physician as possessing
great efficacy in defluxions of the eyes. Oribasius and Ætius added
“<em>Lithargyrium</em>” to several plaisters, and the composition of the “<em>Snow-like
plaister</em>,” from <em>Minium</em>, was long preserved amongst their most valuable
secrets. Whether antimony is the <em>Stimmi</em> or <em>Stibium</em> of the ancients
has been a matter of conjecture; for Pliny, in speaking of its preparation
observes, “Ante omnia urendi modus necessarius, ne <em>Plumbum</em> fiat.” This
plumbum however was evidently the revived metal of <em>Antimony</em>, with
which the ancients were unacquainted, and therefore mistook it for <em>Lead</em>;
besides, the word <em>Plumbum</em>, like many others which I have before mentioned,
was used as a general term; thus, according to Pliny, Tin was
called <em>Plumbum album</em>; and Agricola calls Lead Plumbum <em>nigrum</em>.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c015'><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The question however is unimportant, for this <em>Stibium</em> was never used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>but as an external Astringent, especially for the purpose of contracting
the eye-lids, and thereby of making the eyes appear very large, which
has been considered from the most remote antiquity, as a feature of great
beauty; thus the epithet <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βοῶπὶς</span> is constantly applied by Homer to Juno.
This practice appears also to have been followed by the Jews, for Jezebel
is said to have painted her eye-brows to make the eyes appear big;<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c015'><sup>[104]</sup></a> the
expression also shews that the drug employed was the <em>Stimmi</em>. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Εστὶμμὶσατο
τους οφθαλμους ἁυτης</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>To <span class='sc'>Basil Valentine</span> we are moreover indebted for the discovery of
the <em>Volatile Alkali</em>, and of its preparation from <em>Sal Ammoniac</em>; he also
first used mineral acids as solvents, and noticed the production of <em>Ether</em>
from Alcohol; he seems also to have understood the virtues of <em>sulphate of
iron</em>, for he says, when internally administered, it is tonic and comforting
to a weak stomach, and that externally applied, it is astringent and styptic:
he moreover recommended a <em>fixed alkali</em> made from vine twigs cut in the
beginning of March, for the cure of gout and gravel.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1493, was born near Zurich in Switzerland, <span class='sc'>Paracelsus</span>,
or as he termed himself, Philippus, Theophrastus, Bombastus, Paracelsus
de Hohenheim, a man who was destined to produce a greater revolution
in the Materia Medica, and a greater change in medical opinions and
practice, than any person who had appeared since the days of Galen.
He travelled all over the Continent of Europe to obtain knowledge in
Chemistry and Physic, and was a great admirer of Basil Valentine, declaring
that Antimony was not to be equalled for medicinal virtue, by any
other substance in nature: this opinion however does not deserve our respect,
for it was not founded upon observation and experiment, but on a
fanciful analogy, derived from a property which this metal possesses of
refining gold, as I have before related. He also used <em>Mercury</em> without
reserve, and appears to have been the first who ventured to administer it
internally,<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c015'><sup>[105]</sup></a> for although Avicenna asserts that it was not so poisonous as
the ancients had imagined, yet he does not attribute to it any virtues;
he merely says, “Argentum quidem vivum, plurimi qui bibunt, <em>non læduntur</em>
eo.” Its effects, when applied externally, were well known to Theodoric
the friar, afterwards Bishop of Cervia, in the twelfth century, who
describes the salivation which mercurial frictions will produce. Paracelsus,
moreover, employed Lead internally in fevers,—“<em>Saturnus purgat
febres</em>” was one of his most favourite maxims. He also gives us directions
for the preparation of <em>Red Precipitate</em> with <em>Mercury</em> and <em>Aqua
fortis</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paracelsus, thus armed with opium, mercury, and antimony, remedies
of no trifling importance, travelled in all directions and performed many
extraordinary cures, amongst which was that of the famous printer Frobenius
of Basil, a circumstance which immediately brought him acquainted
with Erasmus,<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c015'><sup>[106]</sup></a> and made him known to the magistracy of Basil,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>who elected him professor of chemistry in the year 1527, which was the
first professorship that was established in Europe for the promotion and
dissemination of chemical science. But notwithstanding this testimony
of his success, if we may credit Libavius, he often, like our modern quacks,
left his patients more diseased than he found them; and it is acknowledged
by his own disciple Oporinus, that when he was sent for to any town, for
the purpose of administering his remedies, he was rarely suffered to protract
his visit, on account of the general resentment of the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c007'>While seated in his chair, he burnt with great solemnity the writings
of Galen and Avicenna, and declared to his audience that if God would
not impart the secrets of physic, it was not only allowable but even justifiable
to consult the devil. His cotemporary physicians he treated with
the most sottish vanity and illiberal insolence; in the preface to his work
entitled “Paragranum,” he tells them “that the very down of his bald
pate had more knowledge than all their writers, the buckles of his shoes
more learning than Galen and Avicenna, and his beard more experience
than all their Universities.” With such a temper it could not be supposed
that he would long retain his chair, in fact he quitted it in consequence of
a quarrel with the magistrates, after which he continued to ramble about
the country, generally intoxicated, and seldom changing his clothes, or
even going to bed; and although he boasted of possessing a <em>Panacea</em>
which was capable of curing all diseases in an instant, and even of prolonging
life to an indefinite length, yet this drunkard and prince of empirics
died after a few hours illness, in the forty-eighth year of his age, at Salzburg
in Bavaria, with a bottle of his immortal <em>Catholicon</em> in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>In contemplating the career of this extraordinary man, it is difficult to
say whether disgust or astonishment is the most predominant feeling; his
insolence and unparalleled conceit, his insincerity, and brutal singularities,
and his habits of immorality and debauchery, are beyond all censure;
whilst the important services he has rendered mankind, by opposing the
bigotry of the schools and introducing powerful remedies into practice,
cannot be recorded without feelings of gratitude and respect: but in
whatever estimation Paracelsus may be held, there can be no doubt but
that his fame produced a very considerable influence on the character of
the age, by exciting the envy of some, the emulation of others, and the
industry of all.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c015'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>About a century after Paracelsus, <span class='sc'>Van Helmont</span> took the lead in
physic; he was a man of most indefatigable industry, and spent fifty
years in torturing by every chemical experiment he could devise, the various
objects in the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms. He was
the first physician who applied <em>alum</em> in uterine hemorrhage, and he acquired
a great reputation from the success of the practice.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Sylvius de la Boe</span>, and <span class='sc'>Otho Tachenius</span>, followed in the track of
Van Helmont.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>A prejudice in favour of chemical remedies having been thus introduced,
the merited success which attended their operation, and the zeal and
perseverance which distinguished the votaries of that science, soon kindled
a more general enthusiasm in its favour. It is impossible to reduce into
miniature the historical features of these chemical times, so as to bring
them within the compass of a lecture: I must therefore rest satisfied with
delineating a few of the more prominent outlines. The Galenists, who
were in possession of the schools, and whose reasonings were fettered by
the strongest predilection for their own doctrines, instantly took the alarm;
and the celebrated contest ensued between the <em>Galenical</em> and <em>Chemical</em>
sects, which has given such a controversial tone to the writers of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. As this revolt from orthodox authority
was in a great degree attributed to the mischievous introduction and unmerited
success of Antimonial remedies, so were the preparations of this
metal denounced with all the virulence of party spirit;<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c015'><sup>[108]</sup></a> and upon this occasion,
in order to support their ground and oppress and persecute their
adversaries, the Galenists actually solicited the assistance of secular power;
the Supreme Council of Paris accordingly proscribed its use by an
edict in 1566, and Besnier was expelled the faculty of medicine in 1609,
for having administered it to a patient. In 1637, <em>Antimonial wine</em> was by
public authority received into the number of purgatives; and in 1650, a
new <em>arrêt</em> rescinded that of 1566, and again restored Antimony to public
favour and general reputation; and before we conclude our remarks
upon the revolutionary history of this extraordinary metal, it deserves to
be remarked, that this very same government that had with such great virulence,
and so little justice, persecuted every practitioner who had shewn
any predilection for its use, in the year 1720 actually purchased the
secret of an antimonial preparation called <em>Panacea Glauberiana</em>, and which
has been since known by the title of <em>Kermes Mineral</em>, from a surgeon of
the name of La Legerie, who had acquired the secret from a pupil of
Glauber. Before this period the invention of <em>Calomel</em> had taken place;
this preparation is first mentioned, although very obscurely, by Oswald
Crollius, in his <em>Basilica Chemica</em>, in 1608, and in the same year Beguin
described it most fully and clearly under the title of <em>Draco Mitigatus</em>, in
his <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tirocinium Chemicum</span></cite>, which he published in Paris.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chemistry, at this period<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c015'><sup>[109]</sup></a> took possession of the schools, and whilst it
was gradually grafted into the theory of medicine, it soon became the
only guide to its practice, the absurdity of which has been already dwelt
upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>In tracing the march of chemical improvement during the last century,
we cannot but be struck with the new and powerful remedies which it has
introduced, and the many unimportant and feeble articles which it has dismissed
from medical practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present century, the rapid progress of Chemistry has outstripped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>the anticipations of its most sanguine votaries; and even in the department
of vegetable analysis, a correctness has been attained, the very attempt
at which had been abandoned by the most illustrious chemists of
the former age as hopeless and chimerical; let us for instance only compare
the results obtained by the Academicians of Paris, and published by
Geoffroy, in their analyses of several hundred plants by the operation of
heat, with the elegant and satisfactory researches in this branch of science
lately conducted in the same country; whilst the former failed in
establishing any distinction between the most inert and the most poisonous
plants, the latter have succeeded in detecting, separating, and concentrating
several of their most subtile constituents. <em>Opium</em> has been at length
compelled to confess its secret source of action, and <em>Ipecacuan</em> to yield its
emetic element in a state of perfect purity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our Pharmacopœias and Dispensatories<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c015'><sup>[110]</sup></a> have cautiously kept pace
with the scientific progress of the age; and in tracing them from their
origin to the present time<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c015'><sup>[111]</sup></a> it is gratifying to observe the gradual influence
of knowledge in reducing the number of their articles—simplifying
the composition of their formulæ—and improving the processes for their
preparation.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c015'><sup>[112]</sup></a> Chemistry has also been the means of establishing the
identity of many bodies which were long considered as specifically different;
thus an extensive list of animal substances has been discarded,
since it is known that they owe their properties to one and the same common
principle, as to <em>gelatine</em>, <em>albumen</em>, <em>carbonate of lime</em>, &amp;c.; so again the
fixed alkaline salt produced by the incineration of different vegetables, has
been found to be potass, from whatever plant it may have been obtained,
with the exception of sea plants, and perhaps some of the Tetradynamia,
the former of which yield <em>Soda</em> and the latter <em>Ammonia</em>. Previous to the
Pharmacopœia of 1745, every vegetable was supposed to yield a salt essentially
different, and therefore a number of alkaline preparations were
recommended, each bearing the name of the particular plant from which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>it had been procured, as salt of <em>Wormwood</em>—salt of <em>Broom</em>,—<em>Salt of Bean-Stalks</em>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, from the very nature and object of a Pharmacopœia, it cannot be
supposed to proceed <em>pari passu</em> with the march of chemical science, indeed
it would be dangerous that it should, for a chemical theory must receive
the seal and stamp of experience before it can become current: a Pharmacopœia
however is always an object of abuse, because it is a national
work of authority, which is quite a sufficient reason why the ignorant
and conceited should question its title to respect, and its claim to utility.
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plures audivi</span></i>,” says Huxham, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">totas blaterantes Pharmacopœias, qui
tamen ne intellexerint quidem quid vel ipse pulsus significabat</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is very evident, that the greater number of these attacks has not been
levelled with any view to elicit truth or to advance science, but to excite
public attention, and to provoke unfair discussion for individual and unworthy
advantage; their obscure and presumptuous authors vainly hope,
that they may gain for their ephemeral writings some share of importance,
and for themselves some degree of reputation, if they can only obtain notoriety
by provoking a discussion with the College or with some of its responsible
members, though such a combat should be sure to terminate in
their defeat. Like the Scythian Abaris, who upon being wounded by
Apollo, plucked the arrow from his side, and heedless of the pain and disgrace
of his wound, exclaimed in triumph that the weapon would in future
enable him to deliver Oracles.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not to such persons that the observations which are contained in
this work are addressed, for with them I am most anxious to avoid a contest,
in which, as a worthy Fellow of our College expresses it, “<em>Victory
itself must be disgraceful</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When, however, we are assailed upon every occasion by a gentleman
whose talents entitle him to respect, and whose public situation commands
notice, I apprehend that a humble individual like myself, may, in the conscientious
discharge of a public duty, deliver his sentiments from the chair
to which he has been called by his professional brethren, without any risk
of compromising the dignity of the College, or of drawing upon himself
the charge of an unnecessary and injudicious interference.</p>

<p class='c007'>The attack to which I chiefly allude, is contained in an historical preface
by Mr. Professor Brande, to the <em>Supplement of the Fourth and Fifth
Editions of the Encyclopædia Britannica</em>; in which, speaking of the writings
of <span class='sc'>Boerhaave</span>, he says, “The observations which he has made upon
the usefulness of Chemistry, and of its necessity to the medical practitioner,
may be well enforced at the present day; for, except in the schools
of London and Edinburgh, Chemistry, as a branch of education, is either
entirely neglected, or, what is perhaps worse, superficially and imperfectly
taught; this is especially the case in the English Universities, and the
London Pharmacopœia is a record of the want of chemical knowledge,
where it is most imperiously required.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned Professor of Oxford, Dr. Kidd, naturally anxious to repel a
charge which he considered individually unfair, and to vindicate his University
from an aspersion which he felt to be generally unjust, published
an animated, but at the same time, a cool and candid defence, to which I
have much pleasure in referring you. With respect to the Sister University,
my own <em>Alma Mater</em>, I feel that I should be the most ungrateful of
her sons, were I, upon this occasion, to omit expressing similar sentiments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>with respect to the course of chemistry, and that of its collateral branches,
which are annually delivered in the crouded schools at Cambridge. Is
Mr. Brande acquainted with the discipline of our University?—Is he
aware that the chemical chair has been successively filled by <span class='sc'>Bishop
Watson</span>—<span class='sc'>Milner</span>—<span class='sc'>Wollaston</span><a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c015'><sup>[113]</sup></a>—and the late lamented Mr. <span class='sc'>Tennant</span>?—“<em>Master
Builders in the Science</em>.” To say that such men have
been the lecturers, is surely a sufficient testimony to shew that the science
of chemistry heretofore <em>could not</em> “have been neglected, or what perhaps
is still worse, imperfectly taught;” and the zeal and ability displayed by
the present Professor, ought to have shielded him from any such attack.
Is Mr. Brande aware that the eloquent appeal of <span class='sc'>Bishop Watson</span> from
the chair at Cambridge,<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c015'><sup>[114]</sup></a> on the general importance and utility of chemistry,
gave the first impulse to that public taste for this science which so
eminently distinguishes our Augustan age, and which has been the means
of founding and supporting the Royal, and other Public Institutions in
this Metropolis, as well as in the other towns of the British Empire?</p>

<p class='c007'>I need make no farther remark upon this part of Mr. Brande’s assertion;
the sequel, judging from the construction of the sentence, is evidently
intended to be understood as a consequence, viz. and <em>therefore</em>
“the London Pharmacopœia is a record of the want of chemical knowledge
where it is most imperiously required,” <em>because Oxford and Cambridge
Physicians were its Editors</em>. Is not this the obvious construction?</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears from Mr. Brande’s laconic answer to Dr. Young, published
in “<cite>The Journal of Science and the Arts</cite>,” that his objections are those of
Mr. Phillips, contained in his experimental examination of the Pharmacopœia;
a work which, I confess, appears to me to furnish a testimony of
the experimental tact, subtile ingenuity, and caustic style of criticism,
which its author so eminently possesses, rather than a proof of any fatal
or material inaccuracy in the Pharmacopœia; and I may urge this with
greater force and propriety, when it is considered that, at the time of its
publication, I was not a Fellow of the College, and therefore had no
voice upon the subject of its composition, and consequently must be <em>personally</em>
disinterested in its reputation.</p>

<p class='c007'>I cannot conclude these observations upon Mr. Brande’s attack, without
expressing a deep feeling of regret, that a gentleman, whose deserved
rank in society, and whose talents and acquirements must entitle him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>our respect, should have condescended to countenance and encourage
that vile and wretched taste of depreciating the value and importance of
our most venerable institutions, and of bringing into contempt those acknowledged
authorities which must always meet with the approbation of
the best, and the sanction and support of the wisest portion of mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>And I shall here protest against the prevailing fashion of examining
and deciding upon the pretensions of every medicinal compound to our
confidence, by a <em>mere chemical</em> investigation of its composition, and of rejecting,
as fallacious, every medical testimony which may appear contradictory
to the results of the Laboratory; there is no subject in science to
which the maxim of Cicero more strictly applies, than to the present case;
let the <em>Ultra</em> Chemist therefore cherish it in his remembrance, and profit
by its application—“<span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Præstat Naturæ voce doceri, quam Ingenio
suo sapere</span></span>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Has not experience fully established the value of many medicinal combinations,
which, at the time of their adoption could not receive the sanction
of any chemical law? We well remember the opposition, which on
this ground was for a long time offered to the introduction of the <em>Anti-hectic
Mixture</em> of Dr. Griffith,—the <em>Mistura Ferri Composita</em> of the present
Pharmacopœia, and yet subsequent inquiry has confirmed upon scientific
principles the justness of our former practical conclusion; for it has been
shewn that the chemical decompositions which constituted the objection
to its use, are in fact the causes of its utility (<em>see Mist. Ferri</em>,); the explanation,
moreover, has thrown additional light upon the theory of other
preparations; so true is the observation of the celebrated Morveau, that
“<em>We never profit more than by these unexpected results of Experiments, which
contradict our Analogies and preconceived Theories</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Whenever a medicine is found by experience to be effectual, the practitioner
should listen with great circumspection to any <em>chemical</em> advice for
its correction or improvement. From a mistaken notion of this kind the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Extractum Colocynthidis compositum</span></i>, with a view of making it chemically
compatible with <em>Calomel</em>, has been deprived of the <em>Soap</em> which formerly
entered into its composition, in consequence of which its solubility in the
stomach is considerably modified, its activity is therefore impaired, and its
mildness diminished.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c015'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, substances may be medically inconsistent, which
are chemically compatible, as I shall have frequent opportunities of exemplifying.
The stomach has a chemical code of its own, by which the
usual affinities of bodies are frequently modified, often suspended, and
sometimes entirely subverted; this truth is illustrated in a very striking
manner by the interesting experiments of M. Drouard, who found that
Copper, swallowed in its metallic state, was not rendered poisonous by
meeting with oils, or fatty bodies; nor even with <em>Vinegar</em>, in the digestive
organs. Other bodies, on the contrary, seem to possess the same habitudes
in the stomach as in the laboratory, and are alike influenced in both
situations by the chemical action of various bodies, many examples of
which are to be found under the consideration of the influence which solubility
exerts upon the medicinal activity of substances; so again, acidity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>in the stomach is neutralized by <em>Alkalies</em>, and if a <em>Carbonate</em> be employed
for that purpose, we have a copious disengagement of <em>Carbonic acid gas</em>,
which has been frequently very distressing to the patient; lastly, many
bodies taken into the stomach undergo decompositions and changes <em>in
transitu</em>, independent of any play of chemical affinities from the hidden
powers of digestion, some of which we are enabled to appreciate, and they
will accordingly form a subject of investigation in the course of the present
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The powers of the stomach would seem to consist in decomposing the
<em>Ingesta</em>, and reducing them into simpler forms, rather than in complicating
them, by favouring new combinations.</p>

<p class='c007'>But every rational physician must feel in its full force, the absurdity of
expecting to account for the phænomena of life upon principles deduced
from the analogies of inert matter, and we therefore find that the most intelligent
physiologists of modern times have been anxious to discourage
the attempt, and to deprecate its folly. Sir Gilbert Blane, in his luminous
work on <span class='sc'>Medical Logic</span>, when speaking of the different theories of digestion,
tells us that Dr. William Hunter, whose peculiar sagacity and
precision of mind detected at a glance the hollowness of such delusive
hypotheses, and saw the danger which theorists run in trusting themselves
on such slippery ground, expressed himself in his public lectures,
with that solidity of judgment combined with facetiousness of expression,
which rendered him unparalleled as a public teacher. “Gentlemen,” said
he, “Physiologists will have it that the stomach is a mill—others, that it
is a fermenting-vat—others again, that it is a stew-pan,—but in my view
of the matter, it is neither a mill, a fermenting-vat, nor a stew-pan—but a
<span class='sc'>Stomach</span>, Gentlemen, a <span class='sc'>Stomach</span>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>What can illustrate in a more familiar and striking manner the singular
powers of <em>Gastric Chemistry</em>, than the fact of the shortness of time in
which the aliment becomes acid in depraved digestion? A series of changes
is thus produced in a few hours, which would require in the laboratory
as many weeks,<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c015'><sup>[116]</sup></a> while in acute affections of the alimentary canal the
functions of the stomach are nearly suspended, and hence under such circumstances,
whatever is introduced into this organ remains unchanged,
even the nutritious mucilages are not digested.</p>

<p class='c007'>From what has been said, it is very evident that the mere chemist can
have no pretensions to the art of composing or discriminating remedies;
whenever he arraigns the scientific propriety of our Prescriptions, in direct
contradiction to the deductions of true medical experience,—whenever he
forsakes his laboratory for the bed-side, he forfeits all his claims to our respect,
and his title to our confidence. It is amusing to see the ridiculous
errors into which the chemist falls, when he turns physician; as soon as
Seguin found that Peruvian bark contained a peculiar principle that precipitated
<em>Tannin</em>, he immediately concluded that this <em>could not be any other</em>
than <em>Gelatine</em>, and upon the faith of this blunder, the French, Italian, and
German physicians,<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c015'><sup>[117]</sup></a> gave their patients nothing but <em>Clarified Glue</em>, in intermittent
fevers!—But I desist—not however without expressing a hope,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>in which I am sure my medical brethren will concur, that, should Mr.
Brande again condescend to favour us with a commentary upon Boerhaave,
he will select that passage in his work, where, alluding to the application
of Chemistry to Physic, he emphatically exclaims, “<span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Egregia
illius Ancilla est, non alia pejor Domina</span></span>.”</p>

<h3 class='c017'>THE INFLUENCE OF SOIL, CULTURE, CLIMATE, AND SEASON.</h3>

<p class='c018'>The facts hitherto collected upon this subject are so scanty and unsatisfactory,
that I introduce its consideration in this place, rather with a wish
to excite farther enquiry, than with any hope of imparting much additional
information.</p>

<p class='c007'>There can be little doubt, but that Soil, Culture, Climate, and Season,<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c015'><sup>[118]</sup></a>
may very materially influence the active properties of a medicinal plant;
while the two latter of these causes may as essentially change the type
and character of a disease, and modify the vital susceptibility of the patient;
the natives of the south of Europe, for instance, do not bear bleeding,
and other modes of depletion, so well as those of the north. This
must be admitted to its full extent, or it will be extremely difficult to explain
the contradictory and even opposite opinions, and to reconcile the
conflicting testimonies of the physicians of different countries, with respect
to the efficacy of the same remedy, in similar diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Influence of Soil</span> may be exemplified by many well known facts;
thus, strongly smelling plants lose their odour in a sandy soil, and do not
again recover it by transplantation into a richer one; a fact upon which
Rozier founded his proposal for the improvement of Rape oil; so again,
no management could induce the <em>Ricotia Ægyptiaca</em> to flower, until Linnæus
suggested the expediency of mixing clay with the earth in the pot;
<em>Assafœtida</em> is one of those plants that vary much according to station and soil,
not only in the shape of the leaves, but in the peculiar nauseous quality
of the juice which impregnates them, and Dr. Woodville states that it is
frequently so modified that the leaves are eaten by goats; Gmelin informs
us, on the authority of Steller, that the effects of the <em>Rhododendron</em> have
been found to vary materially according to the “<em>solum natale</em>;” for example,
that produced in a certain spot has proved uniformly <em>narcotic</em>, that in
another, <em>cathartic</em>, while a sense of suffocation has been the only symptom
occasioned by a third. Rhubarb, as grown in England, will differ greatly
in its purgative qualities, according to the soil in which it may have been
cultivated; that produced in a dry gravel being more efficacious than that
which is reared in a clayey one. Dr. Carter, in his account of the “<cite>Principal
Hospitals of France, Italy, and Switzerland</cite>,” tells us that at Nice, the
<cite>Digitalis</cite> is commonly given in doses of a scruple in powder, or in that of
half an ounce of the infusion made according to the London Pharmacopœia,
every hour, and without any sensible effect; this fact he explains by
stating that the <em>Digitalis</em>, in the neighbourhood of Nice, is much smaller,
and is probably less powerful than the same plant as it grows in England.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span><span class='sc'>Climate</span> also produces a powerful impression upon vegetable and animal
life. It is probable that in southern countries some vegetables enjoy
more energetic properties than in northern climes. The history of opium
immediately countenances such an opinion; thus Egypt produces a stronger
<em>opium</em> than any of the countries on the north side of the Mediterranean,—France,
than England or Germany;—and Languedoc, than the
northern parts of France;—while Smyrna, Natolia, Aleppo, and Apulia,
furnish a juice far more narcotic than Languedoc: so again, <em>Senna</em> by
transplantation from Arabia into the south of France (Provence) assumes
a marked change in its physiognomy and virtues, its leaves are more obtuse,
and its taste less bitter and nauseous than the pointed leaved variety,
while its effects will be found to be less purgative. <em>Cruciform</em> plants degenerate
within the tropics, but acquire increased energies, as <em>Antiscorbutics</em>,
in cold regions; the <em>Menthæ</em> have not so penetrating an essential oil
in the south of Europe as in England and in the north of France. The relative
proportions of gluten vary in the wheat of different countries, and
as in the south of Europe, its quantity greatly predominates over the
other principles, we at once discover the cause that gives such excellence
to the Maccaroni of Italy. Many species of plants secrete juices in warmer
regions, which are unknown in their œconomy, in colder climates; thus
the Ash yields <em>Manna</em> in Calabria, but loses that faculty as it advances
towards the north. The influence of climate, in its relations to moisture
and dryness, upon vegetable productions, is also worthy of investigation;
in wet and cold seasons, our herbage is far less nutritive to cattle, and we
accordingly find that they are constantly grazing, in order to compensate
by quantity, for what is deficient in quality, whereas in dry seasons, a
larger proportion of their time is consumed in rumination; the same
causes, however, that diminish the nutritive powers of plants, frequently
increase the energy of those principles upon which their medicinal value
depends: it is obvious that many herbs are more rank and virulent in wet
and gloomy seasons: this would appear to be a wise and provident law,
in order to apportion the natural condiment of the vegetable, to the deteriorated
state of its nutritive elements, when the digestive organs must require
more than the ordinary stimulus for the due exercise of their functions.
It is hardly necessary to observe that plants, which in temperate
climates are merely shrubs, have been developed into trees, by the hot and
humid plains of Africa and Asia; while in the arid deserts of Nubia or
in the frigid plains of Siberia, vegetable life is confined to stunted shrubs
and humble mosses: cold also suppresses the colour of flowers, and indeed
even that of the leaves, as is witnessed in the <em>Cyclamen</em>, <em>Amaranthus</em>,
and <em>Ranunculus</em> of Lapland and Siberia. But climate not only modifies
the powers of a remedy by influencing its structure and composition, but
it renders it more or less active, by increasing or diminishing the susceptibility
of the body to its impression; can a more striking proof of this
fact be adduced than the well known effects of perfumes at Rome? The
inhabitants are unable to sustain the strong scent of flowers in that climate,
without experiencing a sensation highly oppressive, and which in
some cases is even succeeded by syncope,<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c015'><sup>[119]</sup></a> and thus realising the well
known line of the poet,</p>

<p class='c007'>As I have been favoured with some very interesting observations upon
this subject by Dr. Richard Harrison, who resided for a considerable time
in Italy, and was thus enabled to institute a satisfactory inquiry into this
curious subject, I feel no hesitation in introducing a quotation from his letter
to my readers.—“You ask me what experience I have had on the
subject of climate, as affecting the powers and operation of remedies; I
have no difficulty in asserting that Narcotics act with greater force even
in smaller doses at Naples, where I had the advantages of much experience,
than in England. I might adduce as an example the <em>Extract of
Hyoscyamus</em>, which, when given to the extent of three grains thrice a
day, produced in two patients a temporary amaurosis, which disappeared
and again recurred on the alternate suspension and administration of this
medicine; and it deserves particular notice that these very patients had
been in the habit of taking similar doses of the same remedy in England,
without any unpleasant result. Now that this depended upon an increased
susceptibility of the patient, in the warmer climate, rather than an increased
power in the remedy, is unquestionable, since the extract which
was administered in Italy had been procured from London; indeed a high
state of nervous irritation is the prevalent disorder of Naples. I treated
several cases of Epilepsy in Italy with the <em>nitrate of silver</em>, and with complete
success, while in England I certainly have not met with the same
successful results. During my residence at Naples, I spent some time in
the island of Ischia, so celebrated all over the continent for its baths; many
of the patients who were then trying their efficacy, had been attacked
by Paralysis, Apoplexy, and almost every degree of loss of mental and
muscular power, and among them I certainly witnessed what with propriety
might be denominated a genuine case of <em>Nervous Apoplexy</em>. These
complaints I was generally able to trace to the abuse of <em>Mercury</em>, whence
we may, I think, very fairly conclude that this metal is more active in its effects
in that, than in our own country. Before I quit this subject, I ought to
mention that the doses of medicines, as seen in the prescriptions and works
of English Physicians, excite universal astonishment among the faculty
of Italy. In fact, as I have just stated, the human constitution in this
part of the continent is certainly more susceptible of nervous impression
than in England: it is perfectly true that flowers or perfumes in a chamber,
will frequently produce syncope in persons apparently strong and
healthy, and the fact is so universally admitted, that the Italians avoid
them with the greatest caution.” On the other hand, it appears equally
evident that some remedies succeed in cold climates which produce little
or no benefit in warmer latitudes. Soon after the publication of the first
edition of my Pharmacologia, I received a letter from Dr. Halliday of
Moscow, upon the subject of the “<em>Eau Medicinale</em>,” and as it offers a
striking proof of the efficacy of the <em>Rhododendron Chrysanthum</em> in curing
the rheumatism of the North, whilst in this country the plant has been
repeatedly tried without any signal proof of success, I shall here subjoin
an extract from the letter of my correspondent: “In reading your account
of the ‘<em>Eau Medicinale</em>,’ I perceive that, upon the authority of
Mr. James Moore, you state it to be a preparation of the <em>White Hellebore</em>;
may I be allowed to suggest the probability of its being made from
the leaves of the <em>Rhododendron Chrysanthum</em>? for so far as I can learn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>the effects of the French medicine are precisely those which are experienced
from an infusion of the above plant, which the Siberians and Russians
regard as an infallible specific in the cure of chronic rheumatism and
gout, and from which I myself, as well as other physicians in Russia,
have witnessed the most desirable and decided effects, whenever we had
it in our power to administer the remedy with confidence and courage.
We have seldom given it in any other form or dose than that adopted by
the Siberians themselves, which is to infuse in a warm place, generally
near a furnace and during the night, two drachms of the fresh leaves in
about twelve ounces of boiling water, taking care that the liquid never
boils. This dose is to be taken in the morning upon an empty stomach,
and during its nauseating operation, which generally commences within
a quarter of an hour after it has been swallowed, neither solids nor liquids
of any description are allowed; after an interval of three or four hours, I
have seen the patient obtain a copious and black fœtid stool, and get up
free from pain. Should it happen that the patient does not recover from
the first dose, another is administered on the succeeding day, and I have
known it to be taken for three days in succession, when the severest fits
of gout have been removed.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c015'><sup>[120]</sup></a> Is it not then probable that some cunning
Frenchman has availed himself of this Siberian specific, and concentrated
it in such a form, as to defy all the learned to find it out?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Halliday adds, “The Siberians denominate the leaves of this plant,
when infused in water, <em>Intoxicating Tea</em>; and a weaker infusion is in
daily use, especially for treating their neighbours, just as the Europeans
do with tea from China.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Before we quit the consideration of Climate, as being capable of influencing
the activity of a remedy, the important fact should not be overlooked,
that in India, and other colonies of similar temperature, Mercurial
Medicines, in order to produce their beneficial effects, require to be administered
to an extent which would prove destructive to the inhabitants of
this island.</p>

<p class='c007'>But of all the circumstances that produce the greatest change in the
aspect as well as in the virtues of the vegetable creation, is <span class='sc'>Cultivation</span>,
which may either destroy the medicinal properties of a plant, or raise in
it new and most valuable qualities: cultivation converts single into double
flowers, by developing the stamens into petals, a change which in many
cases destroys their efficacy, as in the camomile, <em>Anthemis Nobilis</em>; for,
since all the virtues of this flower reside in the disc florets, it is of course
greatly deteriorated by being converted into the double-flowered variety;
by the operation of <em>grafting</em> extraordinary changes may also be produced;
Olivier, in his travels, informs us that a soft <em>Mastiche</em>, having all the
qualities of that resin, except its consistence, which is that of turpentine,
is procured by engrafting the Lentisk on the Chian Turpentine
tree.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffon states that our wheat is a factitious production raised to its present
condition by the art of agriculture. M. Virey<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c015'><sup>[121]</sup></a> observes, that by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>suppressing the growth of one part of a plant we may respectively give
rise to an increased developement in others; thus are some vegetables
rendered eunuchs, or are deprived of seeds by obliteration, and only propagate
themselves by slips; such a condition is frequently produced by
culture, continued through a long succession of generations; this is the
case with the <em>Banana</em>, <em>Sugar Cane</em>, and other fruits that have carefully
been made to deviate for a long series of years from their original types,
and having been continually transplanted by slips, suckers, or roots, at
length only propagate themselves in this way, whereby the roots, as those
of the common potatoe, become inordinately developed, drawing to themselves
the succulence and nutrition originally possessed by the berries. It
seems probable that we may thus have lost many vegetable species; the
<em>Tuberes</em> of Pliny, for example, are supposed by Mr. Andrew Knight to
have been intermediate productions, formed during the advancement of the
Almond to the Peach, or in other words that they were swollen almonds
or imperfect peaches; if this conjecture be admitted, it will explain the
fact stated by Columella, that the peach possessed deleterious qualities
when it was first introduced from Persia into the Roman Empire. If there
be any who feel sceptical upon the subject of such metamorphoses, let
him visit the fairy bowers of Horticulture, and he will there perceive that
her magic wand has not only converted the tough, coriaceous covering
of the Almond into the soft and melting flesh of the Peach, but that by
her spells, the sour Sloe has ripened into the delicious Plum, and the
austere Crab of our woods into the Golden Pippin; that this again has
been made to sport in endless variety, emulating in beauty of form and
colour, in exuberance of fertility and in richness of flavour, the rarer productions
of warmer regions, and more propitious climates! In our culinary
vegetables the same progressive amelioration and advancement may be
traced; thus has the acrid and disagreeable <em>Apium graveolens</em> been changed
into delicious <em>Celery</em>, and the common <em>Colewort</em>, by culture continued
through many ages, appears under the improved and more useful forms of
Cabbage, Savoy, and Cauliflower. It has been already observed that
the alimentary and medicinal virtues are frequently in opposition to each
other, and that while cultivation improves the former, it equally diminishes
the latter; I shall have occasion to offer some additional facts upon
this curious subject, under the consideration of <em>Bitter Extractive</em>; <em>see Note
on this Extract, in the article</em> “<em>Tonics</em>.”</p>

<h3 class='c017'>THE IGNORANT PREPARATION AND FRAUDULENT ADULTERATION OF MEDICINES.</h3>

<p class='c018'>The circumstances comprehended under this head certainly deserve to
be ranked amongst the more powerful causes, which have operated in affecting
the reputation of many medicinal substances. The Peruvian
Bark fell into total discredit in the year 1779, from its inability to cure the
ague; and it was afterwards discovered to have been adulterated with
bark of an inferior species; indeed Sydenham speaks of the adulteration of
this substance before the year 1678; he tells us that he had never used to
exceed two drachms of <em>Cinchona</em> in the cure of any intermittent, but that
of late the drug was so inert, rotten, and adulterated, it became necessary
to increase its dose to one, two, or three ounces. The subject is copious
and full of importance, and I have taken considerable pains to collect very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>fully, the various modes in which our remedies are thus deprived of their
most valuable properties, and to suggest the best tests by which such
frauds may be discovered. Very few practitioners have an idea of the
alarming extent to which this nefarious practice is carried, or of the systematic
manner in which it is conducted: there can be no doubt but that the
sophistication of medicines has been practised in degree in all ages,<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c015'><sup>[122]</sup></a> but
the refinements of chemistry have enabled the manufacturers of the present
day, not only to execute these frauds with greater address, but unfortunately,
at the same time, to vend them with less chance of detection.
It will be scarcely credited, when I affirm that many hundred persons
are supported in this metropolis by the art of adulterating drugs, besides
a number of women and children who find ample employment and
excellent profit in <em>counterfeiting</em> Cochineal with coloured dough, Isinglass
with pieces of bladder and the dried skin of soles, and by filling up with
powdered Sassafras the holes which are bored in spice and nutmegs, for
the purpose of plundering their essential oils.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>THE UNSEASONABLE COLLECTION OF VEGETABLE REMEDIES.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Vegetable physiology has demonstrated, that during the progress of vegetation
most remarkable changes occur in succession, in the chemical
composition, as well as in the sensible qualities of a plant; time will not
allow me to be prodigal of examples, take therefore one which is familiar
and striking,—the aromatic and spicy qualities of the unexpanded flowers
of the <em>Caryophyllus Aromaticus</em> (<em>Cloves</em>) are well known to every body,
but if the flower-bud be fully developed it loses these properties altogether,
and the fruit of the tree is not in the least degree aromatic; so the
berries of Pimento, when they come to full maturity, lose their aromatic
warmth and acquire a flavour very analogous to that of Juniper. The
<em>Colchicum autumnale</em> may be cited as another example in which the medicinal
properties of the vegetable are entirely changed during the natural
progress of its developement. See also <em>Inspissated Juices</em>, under the article
<em>Extract</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>THE OBSCURITY WHICH HAS ATTENDED THE OPERATION OF COMPOUND MEDICINES.</h3>

<p class='c018'>It is evident that the fallacies to which our observations and experience
are liable with respect to the efficacy of certain bodies, as remedies, must
be necessarily multiplied when such bodies are exhibited in a state of complicated
combination, since it must be always difficult, and often impossible,
to ascertain to which ingredient the effects produced ought to be attributed.</p>

<p class='c007'>How many frivolous substances have from this cause alone gained a
share of credit, which belonged exclusively to the medicines with which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>they happened to be accidentally administered?<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c015'><sup>[123]</sup></a> Numerous are the
examples which I might adduce in proof of this assertion; the history
of Bezoar<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c015'><sup>[124]</sup></a> would in itself furnish a mass of striking evidence, indeed
the reputation of this absurd substance was maintained much longer than
it otherwise would have been, by its exhibition having been frequently accompanied
with that of more active articles. Monardes, for instance, extols
the efficacy of the <em>Bezoar</em> as a vermifuge, but he states that it should
be mixed with the seeds of <em>Wormwood</em>. Besides, in the exuberance of
mixture, certain re-actions and important changes are mutually produced,
by which the identity of the original ingredients is destroyed; but this
subject will be introduced for discussion in the first part of the Pharmacologia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practice of mixing together different medicinal substances, so as
to form one remedy, may boast of very ancient origin, for most of the prescriptions
which have descended from the Greek physicians are of this
description; the uncertain and vague results of such a practice appear
also to have been early felt, and often condemned, and even Erasistratus
declaimed with great warmth against the complicated medicines which
were administered in his time; the greater number of these compositions
present a mass of incongruous materials, put together without any apparent
order or intention; indeed it would almost appear as if they regarded
a medical formula as a problem in <em>Permutation</em>, the only object of which
was to discover and assign the number of changes that can be made in
any given number of things, all different from each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same time it must in justice be allowed, that some of the earlier
physicians entertained just notions with regard to the use and abuse of
combination, although their knowledge of the subject was of course extremely
limited and imperfect.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Oribasius</span><a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c015'><sup>[125]</sup></a> recommends in high terms certain combinations of <em>Evacuant</em>
and <em>Roborant</em> medicines, and the remarks of <span class='sc'>Alexander Trallianus</span>
on a remedy which he exhibited in paralysis, serve to shew that he was
well acquainted with the fact, that certain substances lose their efficacy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>when they stimulate the bowels to excess, for he cautions us against
adding a greater proportion of <em>Scammony</em> to it; many, he observes, think
that by so doing, they increase the force of the medicine, whereas in fact
they make it <em>useless</em>, by carrying it immediately through the bowels, instead
of suffering it to remain and be conveyed to the remote parts.</p>

<p class='c007'>In modern Europe, the same attachment to luxuriancy of composition
has been transmitted to our own times: there are several prescriptions of
Huxham extant, which contain more than <em>four hundred</em> ingredients. I
have already observed that all extravagant systems tend, in the course of
time, to introduce practices of an opposite kind; this truth finds another
powerful illustration in the history of medicinal combination, and it becomes
a serious question, which it will be my duty to discuss, whether
the disgust so justly excited by the <em>poly-pharmacy</em> of our predecessors,
may not have induced the physician of the present day to carry his ideas
of simplicity <em>too far</em>, so as to neglect and lose the advantages which in
many cases beyond all doubt may be obtained by scientific combinations.
“To those,” says Sir A. Crichton, “who think that the Science of Medicine
is improved by an affected simplicity in prescribing, I would remark,
that modern pharmacopœias are shorn so much of old and approved receipts,<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c015'><sup>[126]</sup></a>
on account of their being extraordinary compounds, so as to be almost
useless in some cases.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1799, Dr. <span class='sc'>Fordyce</span>, in a valuable paper published in the
second volume of the Transactions of the Medical Society, investigated
this subject with much perspicuity and success: unfortunately, however,
this memoir terminates with the investigation of <em>similar</em> remedies, that is
to say, of those which produce upon the body similar effects, and he is
entirely silent upon the advantages which may be obtained by the combination
of those medicines which possess <em>different</em>, or even <em>opposite</em> qualities;
it must be also remembered that at the time this memoir was composed
by its eminent author, Chemistry had scarcely extended its illuminating
rays into the recesses of physic. Under such circumstances, I am induced
to undertake the arduous task of inquiring into the several relations in
which each article of a compound formula may be advantageously situated
with respect to the others; and I am farther encouraged in this investigation,
by a conviction of its practical importance, as well as by feeling
that it has hitherto never received the share of attention which it merits.
“I think,” says Dr. Powell, “it may be asserted, without fear of
contradiction, that no medicine compounded of five or six simple articles,
has hitherto had its powers examined in a rational manner.” If this attempt
should be the means of directing the attention of future practitioners
to the subject, and thereby of rendering the Art of Composition more efficient,
by placing it upon the permanent basis of science, I shall feel that I
have profitably devoted my time and attention to the most useful of all
medical subjects. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Res est maximi momenti in arte medendi, cum, Formula

</div>

<p class='c011'>Medicinal Substances are those bodies, which, by due administration,
are capable of producing certain changes in the condition of the living
system, whereby its morbid actions may be entirely removed, or advantageously
controlled.</p>

<p class='c007'>In adopting this definition we intentionally exclude those alimentary
substances which are more immediately subservient to the support of
life, and to the repair of that diurnal waste, which the exercise of its
functions so inevitably occasions.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been generally supposed, that substances whose application does
not produce any sensible action upon the healthy system, cannot possess
medicinal energy; and, on the contrary, that those bodies which occasion
an apparent effect in health, must necessarily prove active in the cure or
palliation of disease. Under certain limitations we may perhaps venture
to assent to this general proposition; but it cannot be too forcibly or too
frequently impressed upon the mind of the medical practitioner, that <em>Medicines
are frequently but relative agents</em>, producing their effects in reference
only to the state of the living frame; we must therefore concur with Sir
Gilbert Blane in stating, that the virtues of Medicines cannot be fairly
essayed, nor beneficially ascertained, by trying their effects on sound subjects,
because that particular morbid condition does not exist which they
may be exclusively calculated to remove;<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c015'><sup>[127]</sup></a> thus in certain states of debility,
<em>Tonics</em> may excite the system when languid, by their sympathetic
influence upon the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>, while in a robust condition of the body, the
effects of the same agents may be wholly inappreciable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <span class='sc'>Modus Operandi</span> of remedies, or the general principle upon
which they effect salutary changes in the morbid states of the body, is
involved in considerable obscurity, and has given rise to much ingenious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>speculation and scientific controversy. It would seem that the immediate
impression of a remedy may depend upon mechanical, chemical, or vital
agencies; and that the sanative impulse thus occasioned may either be
Absolute, or Relative;—Primary, or Secondary;—Local, or General;—Direct,
or Sympathetic;—Permanent, or Transient;—thus certain purgatives
will occasion intestinal excretions in every condition of the body,
and may therefore be justly considered as <em>absolute</em> agents; while diuretics,
since they generally require for their success, a certain state of the living
system, may with equal truth be denominated <em>relative</em> in their operation.
That the obvious effect of a remedy may either depend upon its <em>Primary</em>,
or upon its <em>Secondary</em> and incidental operation, will at once be apparent by
inspecting the diagram which exhibits the classification of diuretic medicines;
the same scheme will also shew that remedies may be <em>local</em> or
<em>general</em> in their effects, and may excite an action in distant organs, either
by entering the circulating mass, and being thus brought into contact
with their textures;—by occasioning an impulse conveyed through the
nervous system,—or by exciting a local impression upon the stomach and
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>, and thus arousing their energies through the mysterious medium
of sympathetic<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c015'><sup>[128]</sup></a> communication.</p>

<p class='c007'>That certain bodies are capable of evading the assimilating functions,
and of entering, unchanged, into the circulating current, either through
the branches of the thoracic duct, or of the <em>vena portarum</em>, is a fact which
admits of chemical demonstration; many of the alkaline salts are thus
conveyed to the kidneys, and being excreted from the blood by its vessels,
are to be easily detected in the urine by appropriate reagents; I have
made many experiments upon this subject, and am prepared to state some
results which may perhaps explain the occasional value of such bodies as
medicines. Some essential oils, particular <em>bitter</em> principles,<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c015'><sup>[129]</sup></a> and certain
colouring matter,<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c015'><sup>[130]</sup></a> seem also capable of passing the barriers of digestion,
and of circulating to the remote parts of the body; Mercury, and several
of the other metals, would likewise appear, under certain circumstances,
to possess a similar privilege, and the former to be able moreover to facilitate
the absorption of other bodies with which it may be associated, as
I shall hereafter more fully exemplify.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some instances, the medicinal body undergoes a partial decomposition
by the digestive organs, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in transitu</span></i>, by which some of its constituents
escape into the circulation, while the others are completely digested, and
converted into chyle; this occurs with saline compounds into which vegetable
acids enter as constituents. See <em>Potassæ Acetas</em>. It is also stated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>in the history of Diluents, that there is reason to believe that <em>Water</em> may
under particular circumstances suffer decomposition, and transfer its elements
for the formation of new compounds, furnishing <em>oxygen</em> to some,
and <em>hydrogen</em> to others. There is likewise reason to suppose, that in particular
conditions of the digestive functions, a remedy may be at once
rendered inert by its entire decomposition.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c015'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>That an impression made upon the stomach by a medicinal agent,
should be the means of exciting an action in the distant parts of the machine,
will not appear extraordinary when we consider how universal a
sympathy and control this central organ exercises over every function of
the body; imbued with exquisite and diversified sensibilities,—subjected
to the first and coarsest impressions of our various ingesta,—stretched occasionally
to an enormous extent by the unrestricted indulgence of appetite,—disturbed
by the passions,—exhausted by volition, and debilitated
by intense thinking; in short, assailed by numerous foes from <em>without</em>,
and harassed by various revolutions from <em>within</em>, can we feel surprised that
the aberrations of this viscus should give origin to the greater number of
maladies with which we are afflicted, or that those medicinal applications
should be effective that are directed for their cure, through the medium of
its sympathies?</p>

<p class='c007'>A dose of Ipecacuan, by exciting the stomach, will abate both the force
and velocity of the heart in its vital motion, and affect the whole series of
blood vessels, from their origin to their most minute ramifications, as is
evinced by the pallor of the skin under its operation, as well as by its efficacy
in arresting hemorrhage; so the brain, when disordered by vertigo,
frequently derives instantaneous relief from the administration of a tea-spoonful
of æther in a glass of water. The stomach however is not in
every case the medium of sympathy; a substance may excite a powerful
impression upon a distant part, by the instrumentality of the nerves,
without any concurrence of the stomach; thus, the <em>Belladonna</em>, by coming
in contact with the <em>Tunica Conjunctiva</em> of the eye, will occasion immediate
dilatation of the <em>Iris</em>, although no other part of the system is in
the slightest degree affected.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there is yet another mode by which remedies may be made to exert
a sanative effect upon particular organs of the body, through the medium
of what Mr. Hunter called <em>contiguous</em> sympathy, and whose existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>appears to depend upon the mere proximity and contiguity of parts,
without any relation to the distribution of the nerves; thus it is, that relief
is afforded to a deep-seated inflammation, by scarifying the nearest external
surface; while we know from long experience that the thoracic or
abdominal viscera, when similarly affected, receive corresponding relief
from the same topical use of bleeding, blistering, or fomenting.</p>

<p class='c011'>With respect to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Modus Operandi</span></i> of medicines the following classification
may be established.</p>

<p class='c007'>And it is important to observe, that these are frequently antagonist
operations, and consequently, that remedies, although they should occasion
the same apparent effects, unless they act through the same medium,
are not <span class='fss'>SIMILAR</span> agents, but on the contrary, are generally medicinally
incompatible with each other; for an illustration of this truth, the practitioner
may refer to the observations which I have offered under the history
of diuretics.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difficulty of justly appreciating these phenomena, in every instance,
has furnished a powerful objection against the validity of any classification
of medicinal substances which is founded on their supposed
modes of operation; and it must be acknowledged that, if we are unable
to assign to remedies their primary action, or to distinguish this from their
more obvious, though perhaps secondary effects, we shall frequently be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>compelled to place similar medicines under opposite heads, and to include
those of very dissimilar characters under the same artificial division; an
error which has contributed more generally to embarrass and misguide
our practice than any other therapeutical fallacy, and it was the conviction
of this truth which induced me to introduce the present chapter, and
to impress the importance of its subject upon the attention of my practical
readers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is probable that, in philosophical strictness, no two medicines in our
Materia Medica are perfectly similar, although they recede from each
other by such insensible shades of gradation that we may with practical
advantage admit their parallelism; at the same time, it must be ever kept
in remembrance, that <em>those Medicines only are practically similar, whose operations
have been found by experience to continue similar under every condition
of the human body; and which, moreover, owe such similarity to modes of operation
which are compatible with each other, and consonant with the general
indications of cure</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The importance of admitting this proposition will be frequently illustrated
in the sequel; and it may be observed in this place, that every
classification in which it is not recognised as a leading principle, must be
as imperfect in its execution, as it will be unjust and erroneous in its views.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before I proceed to any farther discussion upon the present subject, it
will be necessary to offer a synoptical view of an arrangement of medicinal
bodies founded upon the basis of their operations, in order that I may
be better enabled to illustrate the observations which it is my intention to
introduce: for this purpose I shall present the reader with three different
classifications of this kind; the first being that proposed by Dr. Cullen,<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c015'><sup>[134]</sup></a>
and which is now admitted to rest on principles nearly altogether false,
but the investigation of which will afford many useful lessons of practical
importance; the second classification is by Dr. Young;<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c015'><sup>[135]</sup></a> and the third is
that proposed by Dr. Murray,<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c015'><sup>[136]</sup></a> which, from its simplicity and strict conformity
with the views I intend to offer, will be adopted as being the
most eligible for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c011'>With respect to the classification of Dr. Cullen, we may commence our
objections by stating, that the very basis upon which it rests is a mere gratuitous
assumption, viz. <em>that certain medicines act on the fluids of the body</em>.
With the exception of a very few substances, it is now generally admitted
that medicines produce their effects by acting on the living materials of
which our organs are composed, and not by modifying the specific gravity,
or chemical composition, of the fluids which they may happen to evacuate.
The origin of this latter opinion is to be traced to the exploded
notions of the humoral pathologists, and to the exclusive doctrine of the
earlier chemists; for as the former recognised a depraved condition of the
fluids as the source of every disease, so did the latter imagine that every
remedy operated by producing a chemical change upon its composition;
and the remedial value of a medicinal substance was estimated by its effects
upon inert matter. Thus were experiments made with different
substances upon the blood, and other fluids of the body, in order to deduce,
from the results, the nature and extent of their powers as agents upon
the living frame; for instance, the <em>spirit</em> and <em>salt of hartshorn</em>, as they were
found to render the blood more fluid, when added to it, <em>out of the body</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>were indiscriminately administered in almost every complaint, with a view
to dissolve that “lentor of the fluids” which was regarded as the more
general source of disease. For similar reasons, a tribe of medicines were
introduced into practice under the title of <em>Antiseptics</em>, for the prevention of
a process which very probably never takes place in the living body: the
powers of these supposed agents were, as usual, inferred from their effects
in resisting and preventing the putrefaction of dead matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor is the distinction assumed by Dr. Cullen, between the action of
remedies on the <em>Simple</em> and <em>Living</em> solids less hypothetical. Tonics and
astringents may certainly exert a beneficial effect upon the animal fibre,
but not by any immediate action on its materials, but through the agency
of its living principle.—“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicamentum non agit in cadaver.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>The classification of Dr. Young, although it presents many points of
interest and value, is not altogether free from objection; his classes in
some instances are perhaps unnecessarily sub-divided, without a sufficient
regard to the primary and secondary operations of the substances which
they include. The arrangement of Murray has been adopted in the present
inquiry, not as being less objectionable, in a general point of view,
but as one which from its simplicity, is better calculated, as a frame-work,
if I may so express myself, for the display of those particular facts, the
knowledge of which I consider essential for the successful administration
of medicinal agents, and for the full comprehension of those practical
doctrines which it is the exclusive object of this work to inculcate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Murray observes that, in this arrangement, he places in the first division
those substances which exert a <span class='fss'>GENERAL STIMULANT</span> operation on
the system. Of this there are two sub-divisions, the <span class='sc'>Diffusible</span> and
the <span class='sc'>Permanent</span>; the former including the class of <em>Narcotics</em>, with which
may be associated, as not very remote in their operation, the class of <em>Antispasmodics</em>;
the latter comprising two classes, viz. <em>Tonics and Astringents</em>.
Through these there is a gradual transition from the most highly diffusible
stimulant, to those most slow and durable in their action.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second division comprehends <span class='sc'>Local Stimulants</span>, those, the action
of which is determined to particular parts of the system. Such are the
classes of <em>Emetics</em>, <em>Cathartics</em>, <em>Emmenagogues</em>, <em>Diuretics</em>, <em>Diaphoretics</em>, <em>Expectorants</em>,
and <em>Sialogogues</em>; with which may be associated the classes of
<em>Errhines</em> and of <em>Epispastics</em>, founded on direct local application.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remaining classes include substances which do not operate according
to laws peculiar to the living system. To one division may
be referred those, whose effects depend on the <span class='sc'>Chemical</span> changes
they produce in the fluids or solids; the classes which may be established
on this principle are <em>Refrigerants</em>, <em>Antacids</em>, <em>Lithonthriptics</em>, and <em>Escharotics</em>.
To another division belong those, the operation of which is purely
<span class='sc'>Mechanical</span>, as <em>Anthelmintics</em>, <em>Demulcents</em>, <em>Diluents</em>, <em>Emollients</em>, and certain
<em>Laxatives</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the above classes, says Dr. Murray,<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c015'><sup>[137]</sup></a> may be comprehended
all those substances which are capable of producing salutary changes in
the human system, and which are used as remedies. I have stated my
reasons for adopting this as a general basis of classification, although I
shall deviate very considerably in the subordinate divisions of the plan,
in the hope of establishing some distinctions that may tend to practical
utility.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>1. GENERAL STIMULANTS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The four classes comprehended under this first division, are <span class='sc'>Narcotics</span>,
<span class='sc'>Antispasmodics</span>, <span class='sc'>Tonics</span>, and <span class='sc'>Astringents</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although these remedies differ very essentially in the degree and permanence
of their action, as well as in the character of their apparent
effects, yet, as it is conceived that their <em>primary</em> operation is stimulant,
they are considered as possessing sufficient general similitude to sanction
their arrangement under one comprehensive division.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>NARCOTICS.</h4>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>Synon: <em>Sedatives.</em> <em>Anodynes.</em> <em>Hypnotics.</em> <em>Soporifics.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Substances which, in a moderate dose, occasion a temporary increase
of the actions of the nervous and vascular systems, but which is followed
by a greater depression of the vital powers than is commensurate with
the degree of previous excitement, and which is generally followed by
sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>The relative intensity of these primary and secondary effects varies in
the different narcotics,<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c015'><sup>[138]</sup></a> and even in the same narcotic in different doses;
in some cases, especially if the quantity administered be considerable,
the symptoms of diminished sense and action follow so immediately,
that the previous stage of increased action is very obscure, or not in
the least perceptible, while in other cases, the operation of the substance
is more particularly directed towards the heart and arteries, and syncope
succeeds its exhibition. These facts have led many physiologists to deny
the stimulant nature of these bodies, and to consider their primary operation
as one of a depressing kind, whence they have bestowed upon
them the name of <span class='sc'>Sedatives</span>; in referring to the classification of Cullen
and Young, we shall find that the arrangement of these substances has
been directed in strict conformity with such a view of the subject; but it
may be asked, how the increased excitement and exhilaration which so
obviously follow the use of these bodies, in small doses, can be reconciled
with that theory which considers them as absolutely and primarily sedative?
In order to combat an argument so fatal to his hypothesis, Dr.
Cullen summons to his aid the potent intercession of his tutelar deity, the
<em>Vis Medicatrix</em>, a power which he supposes to preside over our living
body, and with anxious vigilance, to resist the invasion of every thing
that is noxious, or hostile to its health and well being; with such assistance
it was not difficult to explain any paradox in physiology, and the
anomalies attending the agency of narcotic medicines were accordingly,
in the school of Cullen, easily reconciled with the views of a favourite
theory. He supposed that whenever a <em>sedative</em> was applied in a moderate
dose, the <em>Vis Medicatrix</em> took the alarm, and excited all the powers of
the system, in order to throw off the noxious application, and that thus
<em>indirectly</em> arose those peculiar symptoms of increased action; but when
the dose was more considerable, he contended that the preserving power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>of the system was silenced, and unable to offer any salutary resistance,
and consequently that universal depression immediately followed; but
there is no direct evidence in support of the existence of such a power,
and still less of its influence upon such occasions; it is far more philosophical
to refer the operation of narcotics to a peculiar stimulating power,
remarkable for the extreme rapidity with which it exhausts the energy of
the nervous system. No one will deny the stimulating powers of alcohol,
and yet a very large draught of this liquor will occasion extreme exhaustion
without the occurrence of any signs of previous excitement;
nor will any one be disposed to question the depressing influence of opium,
and yet small doses have enkindled excitement and sustained the powers
of life, under circumstances of extreme and alarming exhaustion.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c015'><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>From the celerity with which narcotics produce their effects, it is reasonable
to suppose that they act upon the nervous system through the
sympathetic relations of the stomach, although in some instances it is
highly probable that these bodies are actually absorbed into the circulation;
I am inclined to think that this occurs with opium, as death is accelerated
in cases of persons poisoned by it, by the adoption of those
measures which are best calculated to promote its absorption: (<em>see Opium</em>.)
A still more striking proof is furnished by the fact of opium, when externally
applied to ulcers, producing all its constitutional effects, such as
costiveness, head-ache, nausea, &amp;c. Whether the effects of spirituous
potations are to be attributed to the introduction of alcohol into the blood,
or to the sympathies existing between the stomach and brain, is still a
question of doubt. Dr. Cooke<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c015'><sup>[140]</sup></a> relates a case, on the authority of Sir A.
Carlisle, of a person who was brought dead into the Westminster Hospital,
in consequence of having drank a quart of gin for a wager, and
that upon examination, a considerable quantity of a limpid fluid was
found within the lateral ventricles of the brain, <em>distinctly impregnated with
gin</em>. I very well remember the case, for it occurred during the period
that I held the situation of Physician to that hospital, but it is very doubtful
whether such an absorption occurs under ordinary circumstances. We
well know the facility with which certain odorous bodies enter the circulation,
and are developed in distant organs; it is therefore very possible
that the apparent odour of the gin, which has been sometimes recognized
in the secretions, may depend upon the presence of the flavouring ingredients,
independent of the alcohol?</p>

<p class='c007'>At one period, substances supposed to possess narcotic virtues were
placed about the bed to obviate watchfulness; the plant <em>Anethum</em>, or <em>Dill</em>,
was very commonly suspended over the head for such a purpose, while in
modern times the <em>Hop</em> has been introduced into the pillow.</p>

<p class='c007'>In concluding the history of Narcotics, it may be observed, that there
is, perhaps, no class of medicinal bodies, the individuals of which are less
disposed to bend and conform to an artificial arrangement; each would
seem to have its own particular mode of operation, and to affect sensibility
in its own peculiar manner; and hence the practitioner will often find
that, after the failure of one narcotic, the administration of another will induce
sleep.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>
  <h4 class='c034'>ANTISPASMODICS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Substances which have the power of allaying the inordinate action of
muscular structures, and of assuaging pain, without occasioning that state
of insensibility which characterises the operation of narcotics.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are certain medicinal bodies which would appear to exert a specific
control over spasmodic action, from whatever cause it may have originated,
such are <em>Assafœtida</em>, <em>Galbanum</em>, <em>Musk</em>, <em>Castor</em>, <em>Ammonia</em>, <em>Valerian</em>,
<em>&amp;c.</em> To such remedies the term antispasmodic more exclusively belongs,
but in a more general view of the subject we must admit that this class
branches, by indefinable gradations, into narcotics and tonics; for since
spasm may be connected with the most opposite states of the body, it is
very evident that many of the individuals included in the class of antispasmodics,
can only be relative agents: spasm, for instance, may arise
from excessive irritability, as from teething, wounds, worms, &amp;c. in which
case a narcotic would prove beneficial; or it may depend upon a state of
general debility, the proper remedy for which would be the administration
of an Aromatic Stimulant, or the assiduous exhibition of some permanent
tonic.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>TONICS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Substances, whose continued administration gives strength and vigour
to the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is very justly admitted, that a state of permanent tension in the fibres
of the body is necessary for the existence of life, and that any undue departure
from such a condition is followed by debility. Thus, Sir Gilbert
Blane observes, that no muscle, whether voluntary or involuntary, can
act unless its fibres are previously in such a state, that if divided they
would shrink by their own resiliency, leaving an interval between the cut
extremities; the same may be said of the vascular system in all its ramifications,
in order to give play to their contraction in grasping and propelling
their contained fluids. It appears that there are certain medicinal bodies
that have the power of affecting this state of tension, and when their effects
contribute to its restoration, they are properly denominated <em>Tonics</em>.
We are not, however, to consider them as producing such a change by
any mechanical operation upon the matter of which the fibre is composed,
but by a direct action upon its living principle; it seems probable that certain
poisons may thus produce sudden death by their agency on the vital
principle, by which the tension of the heart and whole arterial system is
immediately relaxed. In this point of view, <em>Tonics</em>, like the other remedies
which we have described, may be <em>relative</em> or <em>absolute</em> in their operation.
Venesection, purgation, or whatever will, under certain conditions
of the body, occasion a salutary change in its vital powers, may produce
a corresponding alteration in the tension of its fibres, and consequently
fall under the denomination of a tonic remedy: but independent of the
state of the body, there would seem to be certain substances that act as
specific stimuli upon the living fibre, and are in certain cases indispensable
for the maintenance of its healthy tone; such are vegetable bitters, which
produce a powerful effect upon the digestive organs, and by nervous sympathy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>upon the rest of the system. <em>Bitter Extractive</em>,<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c015'><sup>[141]</sup></a> seems to be as essential
to the digestion of herbivorous, as salt is to that of carnivorous animals;
it acts as a natural stimulant, for it has been shewn by a variety of
experiments that it passes through the body without suffering any diminution
in its quantity, or change in its nature. No cattle will thrive upon
grasses which do not contain a portion of this vegetable principle; this
fact has been most satisfactorily proved by the late researches of Mr.
Sinclair, gardener to the Duke of Bedford, which are recorded in that
magnificent work, the “<span class='sc'>Hortus Gramineus Woburnensis</span>.” They
shew, that if sheep are fed on <em>Yellow Turnips</em>, which contain little or no
bitter principle, they instinctively seek for, and greedily devour any
provender which may contain it, and if they cannot so obtain it they
become diseased and die. We are ourselves conscious of the invigorating
effects of slight bitters upon our stomach; and their presence
in malt liquors not only tends to diminish the noxious effects of such potations,
by counteracting the indirect debility which they are liable to occasion,
but even to render them, when taken in moderation, promoters of digestion.
The custom of infusing bitter herbs in vinous drinks is very ancient
and universal; the <em>Poculum Absinthiatum</em> was regarded in remote
ages as a wholesome beverage, and the Wormwood was supposed to act
as an antidote against drunkenness. The Swiss peasant cheers himself
amidst the frigid solitude of his glaciers, with a spirit distilled from <em>Gentian</em>,
the extreme bitterness of which is relished with a glee that is quite unintelligible
to a more cultivated taste. With regard to the natural use of
<em>Bitter Extractive</em>, it may be laid down as a truth, that it stimulates the stomach,—corrects
putrefying and unwholesome nutriment,—promotes tardy
digestion,—increases the nutritive powers of those vegetable substances
to which it is united,—and furnishes a natural remedy for the deranged
functions of the stomach in particular, and through the sympathetic medium
of that organ, for the atony of remote parts in general; and I shall
hereafter shew, that in its medicinal applications it certainly imparts additional
activity to many remedies, while it renders the stomach and system
more susceptible of their salutary energies. As an essential ingredient in
the provender of herbivorous animals, it may I think be admitted as a
fact, that its importance is <em>in an inverse ratio</em> with the nutritive powers<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c015'><sup>[142]</sup></a> of
the food, and we accordingly find, in conformity with that universal
scheme of self-adjustment and compensation, which influences all the
operations of nature, that cultivation, which extends the nutritive powers
of vegetable bodies, generally diminishes their bitterness in the same proportion;
the natural history of the Potatoe offers a good illustration of
this fact, for the roots of this useful plant which have been so greatly improved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>by culture, are in their wild state both small and <em>bitter</em>.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c015'><sup>[143]</sup></a> Gummy
matter, which seems to result from the first change of the sap, is undoubtedly
rendered more digestible and nutritive by the presence of a <em>bitter</em>;
pure gum is not very much disposed to yield to the assimilative functions;
“it frequently passes through the bowels,” says Dr. Chapman,<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c015'><sup>[144]</sup></a> “very
little changed, as I have witnessed a thousand times.” We see therefore
the value of the bitter principle, in the economy of the <em>Lichen Islandicus</em>,
which is intended as the food of animals in northern latitudes; we are
told that boiled linseed constituted the sole diet of the people of Zealand
during a scarcity of long continuance, on which occasion, symptoms of
great debility occurred, attended with those of dyspepsia; so again Professor
Fritze, in his Medical Annals, states that vegetable mucilage, when
used as a principal article of diet, relaxes the organs of digestion, and produces
a viscid slimy mucus, and a morbid action in the primæ viæ, an effect
which analogy shews might be obviated by the addition of bitter extractive.
For the same reason animals that feed in marshy lands, on
food containing but little nourishment, are best defended from the diseases
they are liable to contract in such situations by the ingestion of bitter
plants.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c015'><sup>[145]</sup></a> Upon these occasions nature is very kind, for the particular situation
that engenders endemic diseases is generally congenial to the
growth of the plants that operate as antidotes to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have offered these views upon the subject of <em>Bitter Extractive</em>, from a
conviction that they will essentially contribute to the establishing of just
and philosophical notions, respecting the necessity and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> of
many vegetable tonics.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the action of tonics is gradual, so their operation is not followed by
that exhaustion consequent upon the use of diffusible stimulants.</p>

<p class='c007'>The substances which compose the class of tonics are derived from the
vegetable and mineral kingdoms; those of the former are generally bitter,
and produce their effects by a primary action on the stomach, and are not
absorbed into the circulation, as experiments upon <em>Bitter Extractive</em> have
most fully demonstrated; those derived from the mineral kingdom, comprehending
several of the metals, appear in some instances to pass into
the circulation, although several of them, like the vegetable tonics, act
primarily on the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>; I apprehend this observation applies to the
<em>nitrate of silver</em>, which certainly possesses considerable powers as a tonic
in certain cases of dyspepsia, for which it may perhaps be indebted to the
bitterness which distinguishes it.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>
  <h4 class='c034'>AROMATICS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Substances of a fragrant smell,<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c015'><sup>[146]</sup></a> which produce upon the organs of
taste a peculiar sensation of warmth and pungency, and occasion, when
swallowed, a corresponding impulse upon the stomach, which is rapidly
communicated to the remote parts of the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vegetable bodies which constitute the class of aromatic stimulants
are very intimately related with that of tonics; indeed in the most efficient
vegetables of the latter kind, the two qualities are generally blended, and
the transition from these to the more pure bitters and aromatics is so imperceptible,
that it is extremely difficult to arrange them in different
classes; Dr. Murray has accordingly in his classification not attempted
to separate substances which are so intimately connected. <em>Aromatic
Stimulants</em>, however, in a practical point of view, must be distinguished
from tonics, as the former are valuable for the <em>rapidity</em>, the latter, for the
<em>permanency</em> of their effects. Their characteristic properties appear to depend
chiefly, if not entirely, on an essential oil which, when extracted
from the vegetable, exhibits all its aromatic power in a very concentrated
form.</p>

<p class='c007'>Medicines of this kind, when administered for the purpose of dispelling
wind from the alimentary canal, have been termed <em>Carminatives</em>.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c015'><sup>[147]</sup></a> They
would seem to act by imparting energy to the distended and weakened
muscular coat of the stomach, by which the accumulated <em>gas</em> is propelled
through the upper orifice; for this viscus, like the bladder, when greatly
distended, becomes unable to relieve itself, partly in consequence of the
exhausted state of the over-stretched fibres of its muscular coat, and partly
perhaps from a contraction of the <em>Cardia</em>, or upper orifice; for it has been
already stated that a loss of power, and spasmodic action, are often the
simultaneous results of debility.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>ASTRINGENTS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Substances which, when applied to the human body, corrugate and
condense its fibres, and at the same time, exert a tonic influence through
the medium of its living principle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Astringency in any substance may be at once recognised by the organs
of taste; its power in corrugating the papillæ of the tongue, and in
imparting a sensation of harshness and roughness to the palate, being too
peculiar to be mistaken; this is a fortunate circumstance, for there does
not exist any one chemical test by which we can invariably detect the property
of astringency, since it is found to reside in many different classes of
substances: thus, acids, especially the stronger mineral ones, are powerfully
astringent; so are many of the metallic salts, as those of iron, zinc,
copper, and lead; and some of the earths, when combined with acids, of
which alum is a striking example. The vegetable kingdom, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>furnishes the greater number of astringent remedies; and chemistry has
shewn that this property uniformly depends upon a peculiar proximate
principle, characterized by its power of forming an insoluble compound
with animal gelatine; to this principle the name of <span class='sc'>Tannin</span> has been
given. As tannin generally exists in union with gallic acid, and as the
latter body is known by its property of striking an inky blackness with
the salts of iron, solutions of this metal were long, but erroneously, regarded
as the proper test of vegetable astringency; the fallacy of this is at once
shewn by the habitudes of Catechu, one of the strongest of our astringents,
but which, nevertheless, will not yield the smallest degree of blackness to
the solutions of iron, because it contains only tannin, the true principle of
astringency, without a trace of its usual associate the gallic acid. From
the power which these substances possess of astringing, and condensing
the animal solids, their medicinal properties are supposed to arise, and we
may perhaps, in this instance, admit such a mechanical explanation; but
astringents possess also some power over the living principle of the matter
which they astringe, for they are capable of acting as permanent stimulants,
of curing intermitting fever, and of obviating states of general debility.
Astringents would seem to moderate the morbidly increased secretions
of distant parts, and to restrain hemorrhage, by their corrugating
influence upon the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>,<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c015'><sup>[148]</sup></a> which is extended by sympathetic action
to the vascular fibre; it is not difficult for any person to conceive the possibility
of such a sympathy, who has ever experienced the thrilling and
singular feeling which is produced over the whole body, by the <em>acerb</em> taste
of the sloe-juice. As however the primary operation of these bodies, by
their actual contact with the animal fibre, must be much more powerful
than that which can result from the mere sympathy of parts, we find that
the efficacy of astringents is principally displayed in the cure of diarrhœa,
or serous evacuations from the intestinal canal; their operation, in checking
profuse fluor albus, gleet, and the inordinate secretions of other distant
organs, is much less striking and unequivocal, and it is a question whether
in many of such cases the benefit arising from their use may not depend
upon their tonic powers. As the morbid excess of different evacuations
may arise from various and opposite states of the living system, so may
the individuals of the other classes become astringents; and we are bound
to admit upon this, as we have on other occasions, the existence of <em>absolute</em><a id='t82'></a>
and <em>relative</em> remedies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Narcotics, at the head of which stands opium, will frequently assume
the character of astringents, by diminishing the irritability upon which
increased discharges depend. In Diarrhœa, an astringent, properly so
called, diminishes the flow of those acrid fluids into the intestines, by
which their peristaltic motions are præternaturally increased, and it consequently
represses the diarrhœa; a narcotic, under similar circumstances,
might not repress the flow of the acrid matter to which I have alluded, but
it would render the bowels less susceptible to its stimulus, and would
therefore produce the same apparent alleviation, although by a very different
mode of operation. There is yet a third species of remedy, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>may operate in restraining a diarrhœa of this description; not by stopping
the flow of acrid matter, nor by diminishing the irritability of the intestinal
organs, as in the instances above recited, but, simply, by <em>acting
chemically</em> upon the offending matter, so as to disarm it of its acrid qualities;
such, for instance, is the nature of <em>absorbent</em> and <em>testaceous</em> medicines.
In the cure of hemorrhage, if it be <em>active</em>, that is to say, connected
with a state of strong tonic contractility of the blood-vessels, a very different
remedy will be required as an astringent, than in cases of <em>passive</em>
hemorrhage, in which the vascular fibres are in a state of relaxation or
collapse. Sir Gilbert Blane has offered some valuable remarks upon this
subject, with a view to settle the difference of opinion which has arisen
respecting the treatment of flooding after child-birth. (<em>Medical Logic</em>,
<em>Edit.</em> 2d. p. 100.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Astringents are capable of being exclusively used as local applications,
and when they are so employed for the purpose of stopping hemorrhage,
they are termed <span class='sc'>Styptics</span>.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c015'><sup>[149]</sup></a> With respect to these latter agents it must
be confessed, that great popular error still exists, much of which has evidently
arisen from deductions drawn from the effects of such remedies
upon inferior animals; thus have several substances gained the reputation
of <em>Styptics</em>, from the result which may have followed their application to
the wounded and bleeding vessels in the extremities of the horse and ass;
whereas the fact is, that the blood-vessels of these animals possess an inherent
power of contraction which does not exist in those of man, and to
which alone the cessation of the hemorrhage, fallaciously attributed to
the <em>Styptic</em>, is to be wholly attributed. In many cases an application may
owe its styptic qualities to its power of coagulating the blood around the
orifice of the wound; in this way the contact of heated metal will sometimes
arrest the flow of blood from a cut surface.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>LOCAL STIMULANTS.</h3>

<p class='c018'>This Second Division comprehends those medicinal substances, which
have been generally classed under the head of <span class='sc'>Evacuants</span>; for, as they
stimulate particular organs, so do they occasion by their local operation,
an increased secretion, or evacuation from them.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>EMETICS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Substances which excite vomiting, independent of any effect arising
from the stimulus of quantity, or of that occasioned by any nauseous
taste or flavour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before we can determine the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> of emetics, it will be necessary
to take an accurate view of the phenomena and pathology of vomiting.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>It is an important fact that any extraordinary stimulus applied
to the stomach, instead of increasing its motions, as it would in other instances,
actually inverts them: the wisdom of such a peculiar provision is
manifest; it is intended to prevent the protrusion of the food into the duodenum
before it has undergone those necessary changes in the stomach,
by which it is prepared for the more elaborate process of chylification.
The act of vomiting, however, is not effected, as Dr. Haygarth formerly
supposed, by the sole influence of the stomach; the brain is an important
accessary: Dr. Majendie goes so far as to attribute the operation of vomiting,
exclusively, to the agency of this latter organ upon the abdominal
muscles, and regards the stomach as a mere passive instrument in the
act;<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c015'><sup>[150]</sup></a> this doctrine was supported in an elaborate experimental memoir,
presented by this indefatigable physiologist to the Royal Institute of
France in the year 1812.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although we shall not be disposed to receive this theory in its full extent,
yet we cannot hesitate to admit that the influence of the nervous
system is indispensably necessary for producing vomiting; and we accordingly
find that this act will not take place, however forcibly the stomach
may be goaded by emetics, where the energy of the nervous system
is suspended, as in cases of profound intoxication, or in violent wounds
and contusions of the head; while if the brain be only partially influenced,
as by incipient intoxication, or by a less violent blow upon the head,
its irritability is increased instead of being paralysed, and vomiting under
such circumstances is excited by the slightest causes: the fact of such
opposite results being produced by the same impulse in different degrees
of intensity, is no less curious than instructive. Dr. Richard Harrison, in
his Gulstonian Lecture before the College of Physicians, treated the subject
of vomiting with much ingenuity, and I am disposed to adopt the
views which he offered. He observed, that although the experiments of
Majendie sufficiently testify the importance of the pressure of the abdominal
muscles upon the stomach in the act of vomiting, and which can
only be explained by the influence of the brain and nervous system, yet
that he has attributed too much to their agency; “it appears to me,”
continued he, “that vomiting may be explained in the following manner:—<em>the
irritation of the stomach makes a call upon the brain for the aid of the
diaphragm and the abdominal muscles, in order to expel its contents; the diaphragm
then becomes contracted and fixed, the ribs drawn down, and the abdominal
muscles drawn inwards, so that the stomach is pressed on all sides by
voluntary muscles, which, together</em> <span class='fss'>WITH ITS OWN CONTRACTION</span>, <em>expel the
contents</em>.” Now it must be obvious that where the brain, from oppression
or injury, is unable to transmit its influence to these muscles,<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c015'><sup>[151]</sup></a> and disregards
the call of the stomach, vomiting can only be excited with difficulty,
or it will be prevented altogether.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Under such circumstances venesection may in some cases prove a
powerful adjuvant, by unloading the vessels of the brain, and thus restoring
to the nervous system its necessary excitability; where its powers
have been paralysed by the operation of a narcotic, a copious draught of
some vegetable acid, or the affusion of cold water upon the surface of the
body may impart efficiency to an emetic; the operation of <em>Nightshade</em>
and some other narcotic poisons may be adduced in farther illustration of
this subject;—an excessive dose of the <em>Atropa Belladonna</em> produces symptoms
of alarming stupor, and so difficult is it to evacuate the stomach under
such circumstances, that as much as fourteen grains of <em>Tartarized
Antimony</em> have been administered without effect: now if in such a case a
copious draught of some vegetable acid be given, the emetic will be more
likely to succeed: here then we perceive, that the brain, being paralysed
by a narcotic poison, is unable to lend its aid to the muscles requisite for
the operation of vomiting, until its energies are restored by the anti-narcotic
powers of a vegetable acid. The practical precaution which this
view of the subject affords, is extremely important,—<em>not to allow the apparently
inactive state of the stomach to induce us, inconsiderately, to augment
the dose of an emetic:</em> for although the stomach, for the reasons just stated,
may be unable to void its contents by vomiting, it may nevertheless
retain its sensibility, and be therefore liable to inflammation: Dr. Harrison
has reported a case of this kind, where the practitioner, in attempting to
excite emesis in an epileptic patient, by a very large dose of <em>sulphate of
zinc</em>, produced an inflammation in the viscus that terminated fatally.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vomiting may also be produced by the <em>primary</em> operation of certain
agents upon the brain, by which its energy is disturbed, as by narcotics,
or by the motions of swinging, whirling, and sailing: in such cases, the
series of actions necessary for the establishing of vomiting, commences
in the brain, and is propagated by nervous sympathy to the stomach.</p>

<p class='c007'>When an emetic is taken into the stomach, an interval of twenty minutes
or longer, usually passes without any apparent effect; an uneasy
sensation, which we term nausea, is then felt, and this continues to increase
until vomiting begins; here then we perceive are two distinct
stages, each of which is marked by its own proper symptoms; the relative
intensity and duration of which will be found to vary according to the
nature of the exciting causes; thus some Emetics, as <em>Sulphate of Zinc</em>,
act without occasioning much nausea, while others, as <em>Tobacco</em> excite it
to a degree which is far greater than is proportioned to their emetic power:
this is a fact of great importance in directing us in the selection of an
Emetic, for we shall find that in some diseases it is a great object to avoid
that state of system which invariably accompanies nausea, while in
others it affords the best mode of answering an important indication of
cure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nausea would seem to depend upon the exertions of the stomach and
muscles, not being proportioned to the effects of the brain, in order to produce
vomiting. Where this balance however is maintained, as during the
operation of an ordinary emetic, the following are the symptoms which
characterise the two stages;—while the nausea only is present, the countenance
is pale and shrunken, the pulse feeble, quick, and irregular, and
there is a feeling of cold; but as soon as vomiting commences, the face
becomes flushed, the pulse quicker and stronger, although it seldom returns
to its natural standard, until some time after the vomiting has ceased.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>A degree of languor, a disposition to sleep, and a general moisture
upon the skin, are the circumstances which occur after the total cessation
of the paroxysm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The feeble state of the circulation, as indicated by the pulse, and the
general coldness and languor experienced during a paroxysm of nausea,
are to be ascribed to those sympathetic relations by which the brain,
stomach, and heart, are reciprocally influenced.</p>

<p class='c007'>The advantages to be obtained from the administration of an emetic in
the cure of disease, may either depend upon its <em>primary</em>, or <em>secondary</em> operations,
that is to say, upon the mere evacuation of the stomach, or upon
those changes which occur in distant parts from sympathy; and the judicious
practitioner, in the selection of an emetic, will always be guided
by the nature of the indication which he intends to fulfil; if his object be
to evacuate the stomach quickly and completely, he will avoid those
emetics that are distinguished by their nauseating tendency, as in cases
of disease which depend on a disordered state of stomach, connected with
undue distention, and the presence of acrid and indigestible matter; if,
on the other hand, his intention be to influence some remote organ through
the sympathetic powers of the stomach, an emetic of an opposite tendency
may be better calculated to answer such indications: in some
cases, he is to seek a beneficial result from the mechanical action of the
diaphragm and abdominal muscles, by whose pressure the gall-bladder
and hepatic ducts are emptied of their contents, and hence jaundice, arising
from the obstruction of biliary calculi, has been suddenly removed by
the <em>concussion</em> of an emetic: a similar pressure upon the thoracic viscera
may occasion expectoration, and relieve the bronchial vessels in cases of
asthma, catarrh, and croup.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vomiting, when produced by the operation of a mild emetic, does not
appear to exhaust the excitability of the stomach, but on the contrary to
increase its tone; for we generally find the process of digestion is carried
on more vigorously afterwards; although it is probable that, by frequent
repetition, a different result would be obtained, and we should find that its
motion would become liable to inversion by slight stimuli: we may therefore
question the propriety of that practice which is so strenuously recommended
by Hippocrates,<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c015'><sup>[152]</sup></a> and other ancient physicians, to administer
emetics frequently to those in health, in order to prevent the incursions of
disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The benefits arising from the secondary effects of an emetic are numerous
and extensive. It has been observed that during nausea the force
of the circulation is considerably abated, hence the use of these remedies
in hemorrhage; and, as the energy of absorption is generally in an inverse
ratio to that of the circulation,<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c015'><sup>[153]</sup></a> we frequently obtain from a nauseating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>dose of an emetic, considerable assistance in the treatment of anasarca,
and other dropsical swellings. Those medicines that are liable to produce
at once, full vomiting, without any previous stage of nausea, are of course
less calculated to fulfil such indications. In the same manner we should
select a <em>nauseating</em> emetic, when our object is to promote the passage of a
gall stone through the <em>ductus communis</em>, for the nausea so excited will relax
the duct, while the mechanical concussion tends to push the obstructing
matter forward. On the other hand, whenever our object is to evacuate
the stomach, and to prevent absorption, we must take care to cut short
the nauseating stage; a precaution which is highly important in the
treatment of a case of poisoning. The state of the stomach produced by
vomiting is very frequently extended, by sympathy, to the vessels of the
skin; in consequence of which, a diaphoresis not unusually follows the
operation. In the different varieties of febrile disease, this circumstance
stamps additional value upon the class of Emetics; while, at the
same time, that they eject any offensive matter which may be present
in the stomach, they thus control the accelerated circulation.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the violent muscular exertions which take place in the act of vomiting,
the administration of an emetic may be very injurious in certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>states of the body. In consequence of the pressure applied to the descending
aorta, and the interrupted circulation through the lungs, from impeded
respiration, the blood returns with difficulty from the head during a paroxysm
of vomiting, and in plethoric states of the body, or in cases of determination
of blood to the cerebral or pulmonary organs, the act of vomiting
cannot be considered as free from danger. The concussion of an
emetic may also produce mischief in the advanced stage of pregnancy,
and in <em>hernia</em> and <em>prolapsus uteri</em>; while in extreme debility, there is the
danger of a syncope being produced, from which the patient may never
recover, as I once witnessed in the last stage of Phthisis, where an emetic
was imprudently given, with the intention of dislodging the pus with
which the lungs were embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c007'>By violent and protracted retching, a person will sometimes become
jaundiced; the stomach, diaphragm, and abdominal muscles, are, under
such repeated efforts, apt to be rendered, to an eminent degree, irritable;
so that at each effort of the former to discharge its contents, the latter will
frequently be thrown into strong spasmodic contractions, and the liver together
with the gall bladder will be suddenly caught, and, as it were,
squeezed in a powerful press; in consequence of which the bile will regurgitate,
and be carried into the <em>Venæ cavæ</em>; for Haller has shewn with
what facility a subtle injection, when thrown into the hepatic duct, will escape
by the hepatic veins; and upon which Dr. Saunders observes, “I
know this to be a fact, for I have ascertained by experiment, that water injected
in the same direction, will return by the veins in a full stream,
though very little force be used.” When a jaundice is thus produced it
will gradually disappear without the aid of any medicine; the kidneys
are the principal means by which all unnecessary bodies are extracted
from the circulating mass, a portion of bile will therefore under such circumstances
be eliminated in every discharge of urine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The different emetics employed in practice are derived from the vegetable
and mineral kingdoms, some of which appear to produce their effects
by an immediate impression upon the nerves of the stomach, while others
require to be absorbed into the circulation before they display their energies.
<em>Ipecacuanha</em> would seem to act primarily on the stomach, but <em>Tartarized
Antimony</em> has been found, by experiment, to occasion vomiting,
when injected into the veins of an animal; while the other mineral emetics,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> the preparations of <em>Copper</em> and <em>Zinc</em>, undoubtedly operate on the
stomach, and without inducing much nausea.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>CATHARTICS:</h4>

<p class='c018'>Medicines which quicken or increase the evacuation from the intestines,
or which, when given in a certain dose, occasion purging.</p>

<p class='c007'>These remedies, from a general difference in their modes of operation,
have been classed under two divisions—<span class='sc'>Laxatives</span> and <span class='sc'>Purgatives</span>.
The former operate so mildly that they merely evacuate the contents of the
intestines, without occasioning any general excitement in the body, or
even stimulating the exhalant vessels of the canal; the latter produce a
considerable influx of fluids from these vessels, and extend their stimulant
effect to the system in general; and where these effects are very violent,
the purgative is further distinguished by the epithet <span class='sc'>Drastic</span>. Laxatives
then may be said to empty the bowels simply, and to carry off extraneous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>matter, which is out of the course of the circulation; but purgatives,
as they occasion a constitutional effect, may be made subservient to very
important purposes. The effects of a purgative may depend upon three
different modes of operation; viz.</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>1. <em>By stimulating the muscular fibres of the Intestines, whence their peristaltic
    motion is augmented, and the contents of the bowels more quickly and completely
    discharged.</em>
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>2. <em>By stimulating the exhalent vessels, terminating in the inner coat of the
    intestines, and the mouths of the excretory ducts of the mucous glands; by which an
    increased flow of serous fluids takes place from the former, and a more copious discharge
    of mucus from the latter; the effect of which is to render the fæcal matter thinner and
    more abundant.</em>
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>3. <em>By stimulating the neighbouring viscera, as the Liver and Pancreas, so as to
    produce a more copious flow of their secretions into the intestines.</em>
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'>It appears that different purgatives have very different powers in relation
to the several modes of operation above specified; some medicines,
for example, urge the bowels to evacuate  their contents by an imperceptible
action upon the muscular fibres, and little or no increase of serous discharge
attends the evacuation, such are <em>Manna</em>, <em>Sulphur</em>, and <em>Magnesia</em>;
there would seem, moreover, to be certain bodies that have the property of
increasing the peristaltic motions by operating as mechanical stimulants
upon the fibre; it would not be difficult to derive many illustrations of this
fact, from the history of herbivorous quadrupeds, and I have been disposed
to consider the harsh and coarse texture which certain grasses assume
in moist situations, as a wise provision in Nature to furnish an increased
stimulus to the intestines of the animals who feed upon them, at a time
when their diminished nutritive qualities must render such a result desirable;
but the operation of a mechanical laxative may be demonstrated
by a more familiar example; the addition of bran to our bread, constituting
what is known by the name of <em>Brown bread</em>, induces laxative effects,
merely from the mechanical friction of the rough particles, or scales of the
bran, upon the inner coats of the intestines, for the wheat without the bran
in bread is not particularly laxative.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c015'><sup>[154]</sup></a> Other cathartics stimulate the
fibres to a much greater degree, and the effects are either confined to a
part of the canal, or communicated to the whole range of the intestines,
from the duodenum to the extremity of the rectum; <em>Aloes</em> will furnish a
good example of the former, and <em>Colocynth</em> may be adduced as an instance
of the latter mode of operation. Other cathartics, again, direct all their
stimulus to the exhalant vessels, and are accordingly distinguished by the
force with which they produce serous evacuations; and for which they
were formerly denominated <em>Hydragogues</em>, such are <em>Saline Purgatives</em>, and
certain vegetable bodies to be hereafter described. Dr. Cullen has even
supposed that some of these medicines may act solely in this way, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>without increasing directly the peristaltic motion; there is, however, as
Dr. Murray very justly remarks, no proof of such an hypothesis, and it
seems scarcely probable that any substance should act as a stimulant on
these vessels, without at the same time stimulating the mobile fibres
of the intestines. <em>Mercurial Purgatives</em> appear to possess, in an eminent
degree, the power of exciting the functions of the liver, and of thereby occasioning
an influx of bile into the intestines. From the indications which
cathartics are capable of fulfilling, their utility in many diseases must be
apparent; the extent of their importance and value were, however, never
justly appreciated until the valuable publication of Dr. Hamilton on this
subject, in which the author has pointed out with more precision than any
preceding writers had done, the therapeutic principles which should regulate
their administration. His practice has clearly proved that a state of
bowels may exist in many diseases, giving rise to a retention of feculent
matter, which will not be obviated by the occasional administration of a
purgative, but which requires a continuation of the alvine stimulant, until
the healthy action of the bowels is re-established. Since this view of the
subject has been adopted, numerous diseases have received alleviation
from the use of purgatives that were formerly treated with a different
class of remedies, and which were not supposed to have any connection
with the state of the alvine evacuations; thus in fever, the peristaltic motion
of the intestines is diminished, and their feculent contents are unduly
retained, and perhaps, in part, absorbed, becoming of course a source of
morbid irritation; this fact has long been understood, and the practice of
administering cathartic medicines under such circumstances has been very
generally adopted; but until the publication of Dr. Hamilton, physicians
were not aware of the necessity of carrying the plan to an extent beyond
that of merely emptying the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>, and they did not continue the free
use of these remedies through the whole progress of the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cathartics are essentially serviceable also in several diseases of the
class <span class='sc'>Neuroses</span>, which are generally intimately connected with a morbid
condition of the alimentary passages; <em>Chorea</em> and <em>Hysteria</em> have been
very successfully treated in this manner. The diseases incident to puberty
in both sexes are also best relieved by a course of purgative medicines,
and their effects in <em>Chlorosis</em> have conferred upon many of them the specific
title of <span class='sc'>Emmenagogues</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the therapeutical utility of Cathartics extends beyond the mere
feculent evacuations which they may occasion. In consequence of the
stimulating action which some of them exert upon the exhalent vessels,
they abstract a considerable portion of fluid from the general current of
the circulation, and are, on that account, beneficial as <em>Anti-phlogistics</em>.
For the same reason they may act as powerful promoters of absorption,
for there exists an established relation between the powers of exhalation
and absorption, so that when the action of one is increased, that of the
other is augmented.</p>

<p class='c007'>Certain Purgatives, as I have just stated, exert their influence upon the
neighbouring organs, and are calculated not only to remove alvine <em>sordes</em>,
but to detach and eliminate foul congestions from the biliary ducts and
pores.</p>

<p class='c007'>With such facts before us, it is impossible to concede to the opinion of
Dr. Hamilton,<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c015'><sup>[155]</sup></a> that the different species of purgative medicines <em>do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>possess distinct powers over the different species of matter to be evacuated</em>; on
the contrary, there is reason for reviving the ancient theory, too inconsiderately
abandoned, and which acknowledged these different distinctions in
the operations of cathartic medicines, under the appropriate names of <em>Hydragogues</em>,
<em>Cholagogues</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>The importance of cathartic medicines having been shewn, and the
distinctions in their modes of operation established, it only remains to say
a few words upon the subject of their abuse. All the remedies of this
class, but more especially those of considerable power, require caution in
their administration, even in those diseases where they are indicated by
peculiar symptoms, especially if there be any tendency to inflammation,
or to extreme debility, although this latter symptom is often rather apparent
than real, and is at once removed by the brisk operation upon the
bowels; during pregnancy and immediately after delivery, and during the
flow of the menses, the prudent practitioner will use a discretionary caution
in their exhibition. The too frequent use of these medicines will induce
marasmus, and render the bowels so morbidly irritable, that purging
is easily excited by the ordinary stimulus of our aliments; while in some
habits the contrary obtains, and the resource to which the valetudinarian
flies for relief only increases the torpor of the intestines, and confirms his
costiveness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mode of adapting, combining, and administering Cathartics, will
present subjects for our future consideration.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>EMMENAGOGUES:</h4>

<p class='c018'>Medicines which are capable of producing the Menstrual discharge.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Amenorrhœa, or retention of the menses, is generally the effect of a
morbid state of the body, it follows that remedies capable of acting as Emmenagogues
can only be <em>relative</em> agents, unless indeed we are disposed to
accede to the opinion so generally maintained in the writings of the older
physicians, but now generally discarded, <em>that certain substances exert a specific<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c015'><sup>[156]</sup></a>
action upon the uterus</em>. It may certainly be asserted without fear of
contradiction, that there are many substances which, when received into
the stomach, have their stimulant operation more particularly determined
to one part than to another; alkalics, for example, to the kidneys; cantharides
to the bladder; mercury to the salivary glands, &amp;c. Reasoning
therefore by analogy, it was not unphilosophical to conclude, that similar
medicines might exist with respect to the uterus; but experience has negatived
the supposition, there being no proof of any of the substances styled
<em>Emmenagogues</em> producing their effects by any <em>specific</em> influence upon the
uterine system. If the term <em>Emmenagogue</em> be assumed conventionally,
according to this view of the subject, it may be retained without any fear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>of error, otherwise it would be wiser to remove the name from our classification.</p>

<p class='c007'>The suppression of the catamenia usually depends upon a debilitated
state of the body, although it is sometimes the consequence of a plethoric
diathesis; in the former cases tonics, in the latter, venesection may display
the powers of an emmenagogue; upon which occasion, I have frequently
derived the greatest benefit by cupping the patient upon the loins.
Where the disease occurs in young women, about the age of puberty, it
is very generally connected with extreme debility of the system; the preparations
of iron, bark, and other invigorating medicines, are accordingly
the most likely to succeed in its cure. Whereas in full florid habits, when
the catamenia are suddenly suppressed, <em>Laxatives</em>, <em>Diaphoretics</em>, or <em>blood-letting</em>,
afford the surest means of relief.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two other classes of medicine which may occasionally prove
emmenagogue—<span class='sc'>Acrid Purgatives</span>, which act upon the rectum, and
hence by <em>contiguous sympathy</em> upon the uterus, as <em>Aloes</em>, &amp;c. and <span class='sc'>Stimulating
Diuretics</span>, as <em>Cantharides</em>, the <em>Turpentines</em>, &amp;c. which are supposed
to excite the womb, sympathetically, by their stimulus upon the
bladder. Nor is the advantageous influence of mercury to be overlooked,
which, in cases of morbid action in the secreting functions, prove a Herculean
remedy.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>DIURETICS:</h4>

<p class='c018'>Medicines which increase the urinary discharge.</p>

<p class='c007'>This effect is produced by very different modes of operation; and as
some of them are mutually incompatible with each other, it is essential
that we should understand the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> of each individual of which
the class consists, in order that we may direct its application with precision.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is undoubtedly no tribe of medicinal agents more precarious in
their nature and effects than that of Diuretics; this fact in a great measure
depends upon the uncontrollable character of the organs upon which
they act, but it must at the same time be admitted, that their failure frequently
depends upon their modes of operation being directly incompatible
with the state of the system at the time of their administration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following classification may perhaps serve to bring together the
principal facts which are known upon the subject, and at the same time
to display them in an order which is calculated to demonstrate their practical
bearings and relations.</p>

<p class='c045'>1. <em>By stimulating the secreting vessels of the kidneys, by actual contact.</em></p>

<p class='c037'><em>a</em> The substance not undergoing any decomposition <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in transitu</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is easy to imagine that any substance which is capable of entering
the current of the circulation, and of stimulating the kidneys by a direct
application to their secerning vessels, may occasion a more copious urinary
discharge; in this manner the different saline<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c015'><sup>[157]</sup></a> preparations, <em>Potass</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span><em>Soda</em>, <em>Nitrate of Potass</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em> are brought to the kidneys in the course of
the circulation, and exciting the vessels to an increased action, promote
the secretion of a larger proportion of watery fluid from the blood, in consequence
of which, the absorbents are indirectly stimulated in order to supply
the deficiency, and in this manner dropsical swellings are reduced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Water, as a simple diluent, will promote the action of the kidneys, and
it is very judiciously remarked by Dr. Cullen, that by withholding the use
of fluids in dropsy, you will diminish the quantity of fluids secreted, and
allow the secretories of the kidneys to fall into a state of inactivity and
collapse. This is a sufficient answer to those who defend the practice of
enjoining an abstinence from all drinks in dropsy.</p>

<p class='c037'>b. <em>The diuretic remedy undergoing decomposition</em> <span class='fss'>IN
TRANSITU</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The digestive organs appear to possess the power of readily decomposing
all saline compounds into which <em>vegetable</em> acids enter as ingredients,
and of eliminating their alkaline base, which, being in the course of
the circulation, carried to the kidneys, excites them into action, and promotes
the excretion of urine; and it is probably in this way that the <em>Acetate</em>,
<em>Citrate</em>, <em>Super-tartrate</em>, and other analogous combinations of <em>Potass</em> and
<em>Soda</em> prove diuretic: on the other hand, it is equally evident that salts
containing the <em>mineral</em> acids are not under the control of the decomposing
powers of the <em>chylo-poietic</em> organs, and consequently do not undergo any
changes <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in transitu</span></i>, although some of these salts, as I have just stated,
especially the more soluble ones, are absorbed entire, and prove diuretic.
<em>Sulphate of Potass</em>, from its insolubility, is not readily absorbed, and its
composition will not allow the developement of its base; we perceive
therefore that it has not any tendency to produce an influence upon the
urinary secretion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Certain vegetable bodies likewise appear to occasion diuresis by a similar
mode of operation, and it is worthy of notice that these medicines generally
contain a bitter principle, which is probably separated by the
analysing powers of the stomach; as exemplified in <em>Scilla maritima</em>;
<em>Colchicum autumnale</em>; <em>Lactuca Virosa</em>; <em>Gratiola officinalis</em>; <em>Spartium Scoparium</em>
(Summitates); <em>Juniperus communis</em>; <em>Copaifera Officinalis</em> (Balsamum,)
&amp;c. The stimulant powers of a bitter vegetable principle upon
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>, have already been fully noticed under the consideration of
<span class='sc'>Tonics</span>, (<em>page 78</em>), and it is reasonable to suppose, that an analogous
principle, if introduced into the circulation, may exert a corresponding impulse
upon the organs with which it comes into contact.</p>

<p class='c007'>It particularly merits attention, that the diuretic operation of any body
that acts by being absorbed, is at once suspended if catharsis follows its
administration, whether in consequence of the largeness of its dose, its increased
solubility, or from the effect of its combination with some purgative;
for it is a law, <em>that the processes of assimilation, and absorption from the
duodenum, are arrested, or very imperfectly performed during any alvine excitement</em>;
the different effects of the saline compounds of the alkalies with
tartaric acid, elucidate the truth of this law in a very striking manner—thus,
<em>Super-tartrate of Potass</em>, or Cream of Tartar, in well regulated doses,
acts, as we all know, upon the kidneys; the tartaric acid being, as I suppose
in this case, abstracted and assimilated by the digestive process, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>at the same time the alkaline base (Potass) eliminated, and subsequently
carried into the circulation; but if we increase the solubility of the compound,
by reducing it to the state of a neutral tartrate (<em>soluble tartar</em>), or by
combining it with <em>Boracic acid</em>, or some body that has a similar effect; or
what is equivalent to it, if we so increase the dose<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c015'><sup>[158]</sup></a> of the <em>cream of tartar</em>,
that full catharsis follows its administration, then diuresis will not ensue,
since no decomposition can take place under such circumstances, nor
can it be carried by absorption into the circulation. <em>Nitre</em> and those salts
which are carried to the kidneys without previous decomposition <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in transitu</span></i>,
are subject to the same law; for, if we combine them with purgatives,
their presence can no longer be recognised in the urine, as I have ascertained
by experiment. <em>Oil of Turpentine</em> in doses of two fluid-drachms,
may so excite the urinary organs as to produce even bloody urine; whereas
a fluid-ounce will scarcely occasion any apparent influence upon those
functions, because the increased dose acts upon the bowels, and consequently
prevents its passage into the circulation.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Sulphate of Magnesia</em> does not readily produce any diuresis, because it
operates upon the bowels, but the experiments of Vitet and Bracy Clarke
have shewn, that if this saline compound be administered to the horse whose
bowels are not easily affected by purgatives, it acts powerfully upon the
kidneys;<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c015'><sup>[159]</sup></a> and I will take occasion in this place to observe that, on account
of the inirritability of the bowels of the horse, diuretic medicines are
more certain in their operation, than in the human subject; a fact which,
in itself, shews the importance of attending to the state of the bowels,
during a course of those diuretics which require to be absorbed before they
can produce their specific effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>Equally necessary is it to attend to the state of the vessels of the skin,
for if during the administration of a Diuretic, these vessels be excited by
external warmth, its action may be diverted from the urinary organs to
the exhalants on the surface, and occasion diaphoresis; but if the surface
of the body be kept cool, this diversion will not occur: so greatly indeed
does cooling the surface determine to the kidneys, that the usual diaphoretic
medicines may, by an attention to this circumstance, be converted
into powerful diuretics.</p>

<h5 class='c044'>C. II. <span class='sc'>Medicines which act</span> <em>Primarily</em> <span class='sc'>on the Absorbents, and</span> <em>Secondarily</em> <span class='sc'>on the Kidneys</span>.</h5>

<p class='c018'>It has been shewn, in the former division, that by increasing the action
of the kidneys, we diminish the quantity of water in the blood, and consequently
occasion an extraordinary action of the absorbents to supply the
deficiency, whence dropsical accumulations disappear; it remains to be
stated that an operation, which may be considered the converse of the one
just described, is not unfrequently established: the absorbent vessels, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>this case, are first roused to extraordinary action, and the blood therefore
becomes surcharged with serous matter, in consequence of which the kidneys
are stimulated, and it is eliminated through the urinary passages: so
that in the former case the absorbent may be said to be called into action
by the kidneys, while in the latter, the kidneys are obviously subservient
to the increased energy of the absorbent system. The preparations of
Mercury are perhaps the only medicinal bodies which we can strictly consider
as specific stimulants to the absorbent system; and of their power
in directly acting upon these organs there are such ample proofs, that it is
unnecessary to adduce any additional evidence upon the subject. In instances
of increased absorption from the agency of other medicines, the
effect must be considered as rather arising from their <em>secondary</em> than primary
operations; the most important of which will constitute objects of
inquiry in the succeeding divisions of the subject.</p>

<h5 class='c044'>C. III. <span class='sc'>Medicines which act</span> <em>Primarily</em> <span class='sc'>on the Stomach or System, and</span> <em>Secondarily</em> <span class='sc'>on the Urinary Organs</span>.</h5>

<p class='c018'>A Diuretic effect is very frequently occasioned by substances which act
on the stomach and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>, producing a peculiar state of these organs,
which <em>sympathetically</em> affects the whole body, and more particularly the
absorbent system, and the vessels concerned in the secretion of urine from
the blood. As this primary influence upon the stomach, and the effects
to which it gives rise in remote parts, are very different in their character,
according to the nature of the remedy employed, and the state of the system
at the time of its administration; the present attempt to investigate
and generalize these relations, and to adopt them as the basis of a classification,
may ultimately lead the practitioner to some distinctions of practical
utility.</p>

<h6 class='c044'>1. <em>By diminishing Arterial Action, and increasing that of Absorption.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>It would appear that the action of the vessels employed in the circulation
of the blood, and the energy of the absorbents are, to a certain extent,
antagonist powers; the experiments of Majendie demonstrate that the absorption
of a poisonous substance is retarded by a plethoric, and accelerated
by a depleted state of the sanguineous system; the fact is practically
established by numerous phenomena in pathology. Dr. Blackall
has very satisfactorily shewn the existence which subsists between increased
arterial action and diminished absorption. Hence it follows that
remedies capable of controlling the circulation may affect the activity of
absorption, increase diuresis, and cure dropsy; in this manner the <em>Digitalis
Purpurea</em> acts as a sorbefacient, and it may be remarked that it seldom
or never produces its diuretic effects, without a concomitant reduction of
the frequency of the pulse; its power too appears only when it is administered
in dropsy; in a state of health it will reduce the pulse, but not
increase the discharge of urine. Tobacco has also somewhat analogous
powers in promoting absorption, and its operation is accompanied with a
corresponding depression of vascular action. Venesection, upon the same
principle, may occasion, in certain cases of dropsy, a discharge of the accumulated
fluid.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>
  <h6 class='c044'>2. <em>By increasing the tone of the Body in general, and that of the Absorbent System in particular.</em></h6>
</div>

<p class='c018'>That diminished absorption, and the consequent accumulation of serous
fluids in the cellular texture, and different cavities, frequently depends
upon general debility is very obvious, whence fevers, whether of the intermittent,
or continued kind, which have been long protracted, are followed
by <em>œdematous</em> swellings. In states of extreme debility the exhalant vessels
would seem, from their laxity, to permit the thinner parts of the blood
to pass too readily through them; this is proved by the circumstance that
palsied limbs, in which such a laxity may be presumed to exist, are frequently
affected with <em>œdema</em>, and the truth of this explanation is still farther
corroborated by the advantages which accrue on these occasions from
the mechanical support of pressure from bandages. In such cases, those
remedies which are capable of renovating the vigour of the body can
alone prove of any signal service. Dr. Blackall presents us with an illustrative
case of this nature, on the authority of Mr. Johnson of Exeter, in
which the tonic powers of well fermented bread occasioned in the space
of a few hours an effect so powerfully diuretic, as to have cured sailors on
board of the Asia East Indiaman, who had been attacked with Dropsy,
in consequence of the use of damaged Rice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus then do Diuretics, in some cases, <span class='sc'>cure by Evacuating</span>, while
in others, as in the instance above cited, they <span class='sc'>Evacuate by curing</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>A case has lately occurred in my own practice, which not only affords
a striking illustration of the present views, but is well calculated to convey
to the inexperienced practitioner a very instructive lesson of caution. A
man of the age of thirty-five, of the most dissolute habits, was attacked
after a debauch of several days’ continuance, with inflammatory symptoms
in the chest; a very large quantity of blood was suddenly abstracted, and
the bleeding was repeated after the interval of a few hours. The respiration
became laborious, and I was desired to visit the patient; I found that
little or no urine had been evacuated since the attack, and that there were
evident symptoms of effusion, the legs were swollen, and the difficulty of
breathing was rapidly increasing. Under these circumstances I directed
a large dose of <em>Ammonia</em> with some stimulating diuretics, which were to
be repeated at short intervals. On the following day the distressing symptoms
had subsided, a large quantity of urine had passed, and the patient
expressed himself greatly relieved; unfortunately, however, in consequence
of a slight increase of his distress in the evening, an injudicious
friend in attendance, took more blood from the arm—the dropsical effusions
rapidly increased, and life was extinguished in the course of three
days by confirmed Hydrothorax.</p>

<h6 class='c044'>3. <em>By producing Catharsis, and thereby increasing the action of the Exhalants</em> directly, <em>and that of the absorbents</em> indirectly.</h6>

<p class='c018'>It has been already stated, under the consideration of Cathartics, that
certain medicines of that class excite the exhalants of the alimentary canal,
and occasion a very copious discharge of serous matter: by this operation
the blood is deprived of a large portion of water, and the absorbents
are thus indirectly stimulated to supply the deficiency; <em>Elaterium</em>, and
some other <em>hydragogue</em> cathartics, may be thus employed with extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>success for the cure of certain forms of Dropsy, where the vital powers
of the patient can sustain the violence of the remedy;—in the whole
circle of medicinal operations there is nothing more wonderful than this,
that an impression made on the internal surface of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>, by a few
particles of matter, should thus convey by magic as it were, an impulse to
the most remote extremities, rousing their absorbents to action; and, in
case of <em>œdema</em> there, awakening the sleeping energies of these vessels,
which like millions of pumps at work, transmit the morbid fluid to the
intestines and urinary passages, effecting a detumescence of the hydropic
limbs in the course of a few hours, and thus affording a striking illustration
of the sympathetic action of medicines, and an instructive example
of the operation of those of the sorbefacient class.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c015'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The observations which I have thus offered will lead the practitioner to
select the particular diuretic which is best calculated to fulfil the indications
of each individual case; and they will at the same time point out
those which cannot be administered in combination, without a violation of
the law of medicinal compatibility. With respect to the general efficacy
of these medicines it may be stated, that where the disease originates from
<em>organic</em> affections of the chylo-poietic viscera, it will not be cured by the
mere evacuation of the water by diuretics; but that where it has taken
place from diminished absorption, these remedies may be reasonably expected
to effect a cure.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>DIAPHORETICS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The term <em>Diaphoretic</em> has been applied to those medicines which increase
the natural exhalation of the skin, and when they act so powerfully as to
occasion sweating, they have been commonly distinguished by the name
of <em>Sudorifics</em>, but as no difference exists between these remedies, but in the
degree of force with which they act, we may very properly comprehend
the whole under the general title of Diaphoretics: the fluid effused is also
in both cases similar, but in the one it is discharged more slowly, and is
carried off by the conducting<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c015'><sup>[161]</sup></a> power of the air, in the insensible form of
vapour, while in the other case it is so copiously effused from the exhalant
vessels, as to appear in the liquid form.</p>

<p class='c007'>As obstructed perspiration may depend upon very different, and even
opposite states of the system, so may the most adverse medicines fall
under the denomination of diaphoretic remedies.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some affections, a deficient diaphoresis may be associated with increased
vascular action, and in others, with a slow languid circulation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Diaphoretics may be considered as operating, either by directly stimulating
the cutaneous capillaries;—by increasing the general action of the
vascular system;—by relaxing the morbidly constricted mouths of the
perspiratory vessels;—or, lastly, by producing at once both the latter of
these effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>In conformity with the plan adopted on other occasions, I shall proceed
to investigate the powers of this class of medicines, according to their supposed
modes of operation.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>DIAPHORETICS</h4>

<p class='c018'>Occasion their effects—</p>

<p class='c035'>I. <span class='sc'>By Stimulating the Cutaneous Capillaries.</span></p>

<p class='c036'><em>A.</em> By external application.</p>

<p class='c043'><em>The Stimulus of Heat</em>, <em>Frictions</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p class='c036'><em>B.</em> By Medicines which enter the circulation and stimulate the cutaneous vessels <em>by contact</em>.</p>

<p class='c043'><em>Mercurials</em>—<em>Sulphur</em>.</p>

<p class='c036'><em>C.</em> By Medicines which act on the surface <em>sympathetically</em>, through the medium of the Stomach.</p>

<p class='c043'><em>Cold Drinks</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p class='c035'>II. <span class='sc'>By Increasing the General Action of the Vascular System.</span></p>

<p class='c043'><em>Violent Exercise</em>—<em>Ammonia</em>—<em>Guaiacum</em>—<em>Alcohol</em>—<em>Warm Bath</em>.</p>

<p class='c035'>III. <span class='sc'>By relaxing the morbidly constricted mouths of the Perspiratory Vessels.</span></p>

<p class='c043'><em>Antimonials</em>—<em>Cold Affusion</em>—<em>Venesection</em>—<em>Saline Diaphoretics</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The action of the cutaneous vessels may be augmented by heat, without
necessarily increasing, at the same time, that of the heart and arteries;
hence it is that heat is, of itself, often sufficient to produce sweating, while
it generally accelerates the operation of a sudorific medicine. To this
general proposition, however, there are some very important exceptions;
and, indeed, in certain conditions of the cutaneous surface, the stimulus of
heat will be even found to impede, rather than to promote, diaphoresis;
thus in the hot stage of a continued fever, there would seem to exist a peculiar
constriction of the perspiratory vessels, accompanied with extreme
heat and dryness. In such a state, remedies of the third class must be
applied, or conjoined with those of the former. The warm bath may be
said to partake of <em>all</em> the qualities upon which our classification is founded;
it will stimulate the cutaneous capillaries,—increase vascular action, generally,
and, by its emollient powers, relax the morbidly constricted mouths
of the perspiratory vessels. During the ardent heat of fever, the external
application of cold is the most efficient sudorific, as the valuable reports of
Dr. Currie have very satisfactorily established.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the <em>external</em> application of cold was not often employed in the
hot stage of fever, until within the last thirty years, yet the administration
of cold <em>drinks</em> appears to have been practised by the ancients, as an expedient
to produce perspiration. Galen, and his immediate disciples, as
well as the physicians of the sixteenth century, seem to have frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>administered cold water for the purpose of exciting sweat in fevers.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c015'><sup>[162]</sup></a>
Celsus also describes the beneficial effects which arise from copious
draughts of cold water in ardent fevers, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fereque post longam sitim et
vigiliam, post multam satietatem, post infractum calorem, plenus somnus
venit, per quem <em>ingens sudor effunditur</em>, idque præsentissimum auxilium
est</span>.”<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c015'><sup>[163]</sup></a> Cold water, when introduced into the stomach in the hot stage of
fever, must produce its diaphoretic effect through the sympathetic relation
which subsists between that organ and the skin. Nauseating doses of
<em>Antimony</em>, and of other emetics, occasion a relaxation of the surface from
the same mode of operation, and in this latter case, if the force of the circulation
be at the same time increased by tepid diluents, the diaphoretic
effect is more certain and considerable.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Alcohol</em>, <em>Guaiacum</em>, and other powerful stimulants, produce their effects
by merely accelerating the circulation; but in employing such remedies
for the purpose of exciting sweat, we must be careful to adapt them to the
circumstances of the case, and to the degree of action which prevails. In
all febrile diseases attended with much increased heat, or connected with
local inflammation, diaphoretics of this description must be very cautiously
administered, for by accelerating the circulation they might counteract
any benefit which they would otherwise confer by relaxing the vessels of
the skin. In the whole history of medical opinions there is scarcely a
theory which has proved so fatal in its practical applications as that maintained
by Van Helmont, and his disciples, viz. that <em>acute diseases were to
be cured by expelling some morbific matter, after its proper concoction</em>—a theory
which suggested the administration of the most stimulating sudorifics, together
with high temperature<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c015'><sup>[164]</sup></a> in every grade of febrile exacerbation.
The fatal effects of such a practice during the seventeenth, and early parts
of the eighteenth centuries, are incalculable, and may be very satisfactorily
contrasted with the beneficial results which have accrued, in the same
diseases, in the present age, from the use of diaphoretics of the refrigerant
kind.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Saline Diaphoretics</em>, as they readily pass with the chyle, may be supposed
to enter the circulation, and be thus brought to act, directly, on the
cutaneous vessels; at the same time it seems extremely probable that such
remedies may also occasion an impression on the stomach, which is sympathetically
communicated to the vessels of the skin; they have undoubtedly
little or no influence on the general vascular system, and neither
augment the force nor the velocity of the circulating current.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not, however, in febrile affections alone that this class of remedies
proves highly beneficial; the very intimate sympathetic connection which
subsists between the functions of the lungs and skins, renders the use of
such medicines particularly advantageous in the cure of the diseases incident
to the former of these organs; a fact upon which we shall hereafter
offer some remarks under the history of <em>Expectorants</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>So again, in the treatment of bowel affections, in consequence of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>intimate relation which exists between the cutaneous capillaries and those
of the internal organs, gentle diaphoretics offer a valuable resource in their
cure. How frequently do Diarrhæa, Enteritis, &amp;c. ensue from the sudden
suppression of perspiration by cold?</p>

<p class='c007'>From the influence which these medicines exert upon the extreme vessels
of the skin, they are also highly serviceable in various obstinate cutaneous
affections, as <em>Herpes</em>, <em>Lepra</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>As evacuating the serous part of the blood must necessarily have an indirect
effect in promoting absorption, <em>Sudorifics</em> have been occasionally exhibited
in Dropsy, especially in that form of the disease called <em>Anasarca</em>.
It has been already observed that cases too frequently occur in which the
discharge of urine cannot be increased by art; upon such occasions practitioners
have sometimes had recourse to a trial of Sudorifics,<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c015'><sup>[165]</sup></a> but from
the great difficulty which generally exists in exciting sweating in such
affections, the indication has rarely been fulfilled. Where however a
sudorific does succeed, it is less liable to debilitate than the other alternative
of a drastic purgative.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is still another point of view in which the therapeutic importance
of Diaphoretics may be considered. It is generally acknowledged that
by cutaneous transpiration a portion of excrementitious matter is ejected
from the system; hence by the failure or imperfect performance of this
function, a deleterious fluid is retained which may give origin to disease;
to such a cause may perhaps be attributed the generation of Calculi, and
other diseases of the urinary system, as we shall have occasion to notice
under the head of <em>Lithonthryptics</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The increased efficacy which these medicines derive from combination
with each other, will form a subject of interesting enquiry in the succeeding
essay.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>EXPECTORANTS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Medicines which are supposed to be capable of facilitating the excretion
of mucus from the breast, <em>ex pectore</em>, that is, from the trachea, and cells
and passages of the lungs.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the term <em>Expectorant</em> be intended to express a medicinal substance
which has the power of promoting the expulsion of fluid from the lungs,
by some <em>specific action</em> on the parts concerned, we can have no hesitation
in at once rejecting the word, and denying the existence of such remedies:
if, however the term be received, conventionally, as comprehending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>all those substances which are capable, according to the state of the system
in each particular case, of producing expectoration, it will be extremely
proper to recognise, and practically useful to retain, such a class of medicinal
agents. In order that their <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> may be correctly understood,
the following classification is submitted to the reader.</p>

  <h5 class='c044'>I. <span class='sc'>Of Medicines which increase Pulmonary Exhalation.</span></h5>
</div>

<h6 class='c044'><em>a.</em> <em>By removing constriction of the Pulmonary Exhalant vessels.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>There can be no doubt but that, in certain states of disease, the exhalants
of the lungs, like those of the skin, are affected by a spasmodic constriction,
in consequence of which the usual quantity of fluid for the lubrication
of these parts, is not effused, whence a train of morbid phenomena
arise; this appears to happen in <em>Pneumonia</em>, <em>Asthma</em>, and certain
other diseases of the pulmonary organs. In order to remove such a constriction,
remedies of the Antispasmodic class may be exhibited with advantage;
nauseating doses of Tartarized Antimony, or of Ipecacuanha,
are likewise calculated to fulfil the same indication, by an operation analogous
to that by which Diaphoresis is produced. If the term might be allowed
we should call such remedies <em>Pulmonary Diaphoretics</em>. It is in this
way that Venesection, Blisters, and other anti-phlogistic remedies, may in
certain states of the lungs restore a healthy excretion from these vessels.</p>

<h6 class='c044'><em>b.</em> <em>By stimulating the Pulmonary Exhalants, by the actual contact of a medicinal substance.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>There certainly appear to be substances which enter the circulation,
and are more peculiarly determined to the pulmonary vessels, since their
odour is to be distinctly recognised in the air that is expired. <em>Garlic</em> may
be adduced as an example of this kind; so penetrating is its odorous principle,
that if it be only applied to the soles of the feet it may be perceived
in the breath. Such substances may stimulate the exhalant vessels
through which they pass, and by this stimulus the secretion may be increased,
and the mucus contained in the follicles diluted, so as to be poured
out in a less viscid form, and consequently in a state to be more easily
brought up by expectoration.</p>

<h6 class='c044'><em>c.</em> <em>By stimulating the top of the trachea, and thereby increasing the activity of the Exhalant vessels of the lungs, by a species of contiguous sympathy.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>The salutary operation of those various remedies, which are allowed to
pass slowly over the fauces, sufficiently establish the fact which is here
announced. In this manner I apprehend that much benefit may arise
from the use of a <em>Linctus</em>, and I am satisfied from experience that certain
cases of hoarseness are to be frequently removed by such an application of
stimulating syrups.</p>

<p class='c007'>The inhalation of certain vapours will also enable us to make a more
direct application to these parts; as, however, it is my intention to dedicate
a chapter to the consideration of this form of remedy, it is unnecessary
to dwell upon it in this place.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>
  <h5 class='c034'>II. <span class='sc'>Of Medicines which diminish the inordinate flow of fluid into the lungs.</span></h5>
</div>

<h6 class='c044'><em>a.</em> <em>By removing the debility of the Exhalants.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>It not unfrequently occurs in persons either debilitated by age or disease,
that the exhalant vessels of the lungs lose their tone, and pour out a larger
quantity of fluid than is necessary for the lubrication of these organs; this
is particularly observable in the disease called <em>humoral asthma</em>, and in the
catarrh of old persons: if this excess be restrained by strengthening the
tone of the system generally, or by astringing these vessels in particular,
the expectoration of the remainder will be rendered much more easy. According
to my experience, <em>sulphate of zinc</em> displays considerable powers in
moderating this effusion of fluid, and it appears to produce this effect by
increasing the tone of the exhalant vessels of the lungs; several medicines
also, which are included in the former division of this classification, may,
by stimulating these organs, not only promote the exhalation when it is
too scanty, but repress it when it is too abundant.</p>

<h6 class='c044'><em>b.</em> <em>By increasing the power of the Absorbents.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>In some cases, the mucous inundation may not depend upon any fault
in the exhalants, but upon a torpid state of the pulmonary absorbents: our
remedy for this evil is to be found amongst that class of medicines which
have the power of promoting absorption, as small doses of some mercurial
preparation, <em>Digitalis</em>, and perhaps <em>Nicotiana</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<h6 class='c044'><em>c.</em> <em>By determining to the skin by a gentle diaphoresis.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>It is evident that an increase of the cutaneous exhalation is generally
attended with a relative diminution in the other serous excretions of body;
this is so obvious with respect to our urinary discharge, that every person
must have noticed the variation of its quantity at different seasons of the
year: in like manner the exhalation from the lungs, although less capable
of becoming an object of observation, is not less affected by the state of the
cutaneous discharge; hence medicines capable of promoting it, are calculated
to diminish the quantity of serous exhalation from the lungs; and
it is upon this principle, that well regulated doses of the compound powder
of Ipecacuan], frequently furnish the oppressed asthmatic with a valuable
resource.</p>

<h6 class='c044'><em>d.</em> <em>By exciting serous discharges from the bowels.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>Upon the principle announced in the preceding section, the operation of
a saline cathartic may relieve the pulmonary organs when loaded with a
preternatural accumulation of fluid, and consequently assist expectoration.
On the contrary, if the exhalation be deficient, this class of remedies may
increase pulmonary irritation, and check expectoration, a fact which coincides
with the concurrent testimony of many able practitioners.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>
  <h5 class='c034'>III. <span class='sc'>Of Medicines which operate</span> <em>mechanically</em>.</h5>
</div>

<h6 class='c044'><em>a.</em> <em>By imparting vigour to the respiratory muscles, engaged in the act of expectorating.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>It must be admitted that, to a certain extent, expectoration is a voluntary
operation, connected with the action of a variety of muscles, which
in a state of extreme debility are not easily excited into action: every
practitioner must have noticed this fact during the treatment of the coughs
of exhausted patients, and have witnessed the distress necessarily arising
from it; in this condition, the exhibition of a stimulant may so far renew
the exhausted excitability of these organs, as to enable them to undergo
the necessary exertions.</p>

<h6 class='c044'><em>b.</em> <em>By compressing the thoracic viscera, through the operation of an emetic.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>The beneficial results which frequently attend the concussion of an
emetic, in cases of mucous accumulations in the lungs, are too well known
and understood to require much elucidation: in the act of vomiting the
thoracic viscera are violently compressed, the neighbouring muscles are
also called into strong action, and both expiration and inspiration are thus
rendered more forcible, and the expulsion of mucus from the cavity of the
lungs necessarily accomplished.</p>

<p class='c007'>The safety and expediency of such a resource must, however, in each
particular case be left to the discretion of the medical practitioner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides the remedies above enumerated, there are some others which
afford relief in certain coughs, and have therefore in popular medicine,
been considered as <em>Expectorants</em>; but their operation, if they exert any, is
to be explained upon principles altogether different from that of facilitating
expectoration, and will more properly fall under the head of <em>Demulcents</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Atmospheric changes, in relation to moisture and dryness, deserve some
notice before we conclude the history of expectorant agents: the subject
teems with curious and important facts, and the advantages which the
asthmatic patient derives from such changes merit farther investigation.
That the lungs are constantly giving off aqueous vapour is made evident
by condensing the expired air on a cold surface of glass or metal; and it
is easy to imagine that when the atmosphere is saturated with moisture,
its power of conducting off this vapour will be proportionably diminished,
and that an accumulation of fluid may thus take place in the lungs; on
the other hand, we may suppose the air to be so dry as to have an increased
capacity for moisture, and to carry off the expired vapour with preternatural
avidity; in either of these cases, the excretions from the lungs
will be materially influenced, whether to the benefit or disadvantage of
the patient will depend, in each particular instance, upon the nature of the
disease under which he suffers. I have known a person who could
breathe with more freedom in the thick fogs of the metropolis than in the
pure air of a mountainous region, and it would not be difficult to adduce
many examples in illustration of a diametrically opposite constitution of
the pulmonary organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the same cause we may frequently observe remarkable changes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>occur in the character of a cough, at the breaking up of a frost; in some
cases the expectoration will be checked, and in others promoted by a sudden
change from a dry to a moist atmosphere. Can a more instructive
illustration be offered of that important fact, which I have been labouring
in every page to impress upon the mind of the young practitioner, that,
<em>remedies are only relative agents</em>?</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of considerable experience in the treatment of pulmonary
complaints, and in the influence of climate and seasons upon them, I have
repeatedly observed the rapid transition from moisture to dryness to occasion
very remarkable effects upon the disease; and I much question whether
an attention to such a condition of the atmosphere does not deserve
as much consideration in the election of a suitable place of residence for
such invalids, as the more obvious circumstance of temperature. I have
been long in the habit of recommending to persons confined in artificially
warmed apartments, to evaporate a certain portion of water, whenever
the external air has become excessively dry by the prevalence of the
north-east winds, which so frequently infest this island during the months
of Spring; and the most marked advantage has attended the practice.
But in such cases the practitioner must ever be guided by the symptoms of
each particular case; it would be worse than useless to lay down any general
precept for his guidance. We cannot then be surprised that such a
difference of opinion should exist amongst practitioners of equal eminence,
respecting the influence of a marine atmosphere; some advocating
its advantages to the pulmonary invalid, and others maintaining with
equal confidence the injurious tendency of such localities; each party appeals
to <em>experience</em> in justification of his opinion, and with equal candour
and justice; but the cases from the results of which the medical inference
has been drawn, however parallel they may have appeared, differed
in those essential points to which we have alluded, and upon which the
question of climate would seem to turn. There is another circumstance
connected with the subject of atmospheric moisture which it is also essential
to remember,—that the air gains a considerable increase in its power
of conducting caloric, by becoming saturated with aqueous vapour; thus,
when a thaw takes place, and the thermometer rises a few degrees above
32°, the air, instead of impressing us with the sensation of increased temperature,
actually appears much colder.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>SIALOGOGUES;</h4>

<p class='c018'>Substances which increase the salivary<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c015'><sup>[166]</sup></a> discharge. This class comprehends
two orders of medicines, viz.</p>

<p class='c007'>1st. Those which increase the salivary excretion by <em>external</em> application
to the secreting vessels, by mastication, as the following acrimonious
and pungent substances, <em>Anthemis Pyrethrum</em>; <em>Colchearia Armoracia</em>;
<em>Daphne Mezereum</em>; <em>Nicotiana Tabacum</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>2nd. Those whose <em>internal</em> exhibition affects these organs through the
medium of the circulation, of which <em>Mercury</em> is the only true example;
for all the preparations of this metal, when administered in certain quantities,
produce salivation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The acrid Sialogogues, or Masticatories, by stimulating the excretory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>ducts, and increasing the secretion of saliva, sometimes relieve the pain of
tooth-ache, and are commonly resorted to for that purpose; they are besides
supposed capable of relieving other congestions, or inflammatory dispositions,
in remote parts of the head, by the derivation they occasion
from the neighbouring vessels, especially the branches of the external carotid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mercury, in its metallic state,<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c015'><sup>[167]</sup></a> is perfectly inert, and does not exert any
influence whatever upon the living body: this fact is sufficient, if any serious
refutation were necessary, to overturn the theory which attributes its
sialogogue property to the gravity of its particles, by which “it is disposed
to retain the <em>direct line</em> in which it is propelled from the heart, and is
therefore more certainly determined to the vessels of the head.” It has
been also supposed to act by diminishing the <em>lentor</em> of the blood, and disposing
it to pass more easily into the salivary glands, so as to increase
their secretion: equally gratuitous and improbable are the chemical hypothesis
which have been offered to explain this curious and singular
property; Dr. Cullen endeavoured to solve the problem, by supposing that
“<em>Mercury has a particular disposition to unite with ammoniacal salts, and that
such salts are disposed to pass off by the salivary glands more copiously than
by any other excretion</em>.” Dr. Murray, however, very justly remarks that
mercury has not any peculiar tendency of this kind; and that if it had,
these salts are not more abundant in the saliva, than in some other secretions.
Dr. Murray then proceeds to submit a theory which he considers
better calculated to explain the phenomenon; he observes, that the urine
appears more peculiarly designed to convey matter which has been received
into the circulating mass, but which is still excrementitious, from
the system. To pass, however, with this fluid, it is necessary that the
matter conveyed should be soluble in it; and when it is so, we can discover
it in the secretion by chemical tests. If there is any property connected
with it, therefore, which shall prevent this solubility, it probably
will prevent the substance from being secreted. Now, the <em>phosphoric acid</em>,
abundant in urine, must in this mode counteract the secretion of mercury
in any form of preparation, by forming with it a compound, insoluble, and
to which the slight excess of acid cannot communicate solubility; the
mercury, therefore, existing in the circulating mass, when brought in the
course of the circulation to the secreting vessels of the kidneys, will not
pass through their whole course; but if conveyed so far as to be combined
with <em>phosphoric acid</em>, will, from this combination, be incapable of being
conveyed onwards, and will therefore be retained in the composition of that
part of the blood which does not enter into the secretion, but returns into
the circulation. It must be discharged by some other emunctory; a portion
of it appears, from some facts, to pass off by the insensible perspiration;
but the <em>tenuity</em> of this secretion, if the term may be employed, must
be unfavourable to this mode of discharge. The salivary secretion is one
by which it may be more easily transmitted; and this transmission may
even be facilitated by the affinity exerted to the <em>Oxide of Mercury</em> by the
<em>Muriatic Acid</em>, the <em>Soda</em>, and <em>Ammonia</em>, which are the chief saline ingredients
in saliva; for it deserves to be remarked that triple compounds of
these substances are, to a certain extent, soluble in water; and if the <em>Mercury</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>is thus secreted, it will of course stimulate the secreting vessels
through which it passes, and increase the discharge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Gilbert Blane<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c015'><sup>[168]</sup></a> has lately advanced another hypothesis to account
for the effects of mercury as a sialogogue; he considers the salivary
glands as one of the outlets for the <em>ramenta</em> of the bones, for by analysing
the saliva we discover the principles of which they consist; indeed the
osseous matter not unfrequently concretes on the teeth, and sometimes on
the salivary ducts, in the form of what is called <em>Tartar:</em> “does not this
fact,” says Sir Gilbert Blane, “in some measure account for these glands
being the parts upon which determination is made by the operation of mercury,
which consists in exciting an active absorption of solid parts, as I
have elsewhere observed?”<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c015'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But do not the kidneys, and other excretory glands also furnish outlets,
through which the <em>detritus</em> of the body is eliminated. How does it happen,
therefore, that the kidneys are not as equally affected as the salivary
glands by the action of mercury? In the present state of our knowledge
it will be more prudent to rest on the phenomenon as an ultimate fact,
than in attempting to ascend higher in the scale of causes, to involve ourselves
in impenetrable darkness.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the prevalence of the theory which attributed to <em>Nitric acid</em> all
the antisyphilitic powers of mercury, it was even maintained that this acid
also excited ptyalism; experience however has disproved the effects thus
attributed to it, and no one attempts to support its pretensions, as a sialogogue,
except indeed as it may perchance, by its acrid qualities, influence
the excretory ducts of the glands, externally, in the act of being swallowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has very lately been stated by Dr. Macleod,<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c015'><sup>[170]</sup></a> that the <em>Hydro-cyanic
acid</em> occasionally produces soreness of the gums, and a disposition to ptyalism;
this, if true, is a very remarkable fact, and well deserves attentive
consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some theorists may, perhaps, be inclined to consider certain Nauseating
Medicines as possessing sialogogue properties. It cannot be denied that
an increased discharge of saliva will take place during the operation of
such remedies, but it is very transient, and can never be rendered available
to any therapeutic object. I shall however have occasion to refer to
this fact hereafter, and to the inference deduced from it by Dr. Eberle, in
explanation of the effect of nauseating medicines in promoting the operation
of Mercury.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>ERRHINES, or STERNUTATORIES:</h4>

<p class='c018'>Substances which, by direct application to the pituitary membrane, occasion
a discharge from the nostrils either of a mucous or serous fluid.
This class contains several different species, whose operation varies in intensity,
as well as in duration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Errhines have been regarded as useful in consequence of the evacuation
they occasion, but in this respect their value has been greatly over-rated;
it has been stated, that they diminish the quantity of fluid circulating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>in the neighbouring vessels, and even extend their influence to all the
branches of the external carotid; and Dr. Cullen says that he has, apparently
from this operation, known head-ache, pain of the ear, and some
cases of ophthalmia, cured or relieved by the use of Errhines. There can
be no doubt that local stimulants of this kind will frequently remove pain
from the head and neighbouring parts, but not merely by occasioning vascular
depletion, as Dr. Cullen supposed, but by a stimulant operation conveyed
through the medium of nervous communication, or contiguous sympathy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Cullen has moreover supposed, that these substances may be useful
in preventing apoplexy or palsy. Morgagni<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c015'><sup>[171]</sup></a> however relates a case
in which sneezing induced a fatal attack of this disease; and Van Swieten<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c015'><sup>[172]</sup></a>
has satisfactorily shewn, that continued paroxysms of sneezing tend
to load the vessels of the head with blood; for the violent contraction of
the chest impedes, for a time, the passage of the blood through the lungs,
and therefore obstructs the return of the venous blood from the brain, the
vessels of which are in consequence greatly distended; the face therefore
reddens and becomes turgid, the eyes are suffused with water, and appear
full and distended. Its occasional dangerous violence is said to have given
origin to the benediction so universally bestowed on those who sneeze.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c015'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It has been a subject of popular inquiry, how far the habitual use of
Snuff may prove beneficial or injurious; and whether the habit, when
once fully established, can be discontinued with impunity? It may be
remarked that Snuff, by habitual use, soon ceases to produce the effect
of an Errhine, for which reason its discontinuance cannot, generally, be
regarded as likely to be attended with any danger; in those cases, however,
in which the discharge is perpetuated, a contrary judgment should
be pronounced, for all artificial discharges become constitutional by long
continuance, and can therefore be seldom checked with impunity. Dr.
Cullen states, from experience, that “whenever the nasal discharge has
been considerable, the laying aside the custom of taking snuff has been
productive of evil.”</p>

<h4 class='c034'>EPISPASTICS. <em>Vesicatories.</em> <em>Blisters.</em></h4>

<p class='c018'>External applications to the skin, which produce a serous or puriform
discharge, by previously exciting a high state of inflammation.</p>

<p class='c007'>When these agents act so mildly as merely to excite inflammation,
without occasioning the effusion of serum, they are denominated <span class='sc'>Rubefacients</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Various substances have at different times, been proposed for the accomplishment
of this object,—such as <em>Nitric Acid</em>, <em>Boiling Water</em>, <em>Strong
Acetic Acid</em>, <em>Tartarized Antimony</em>, &amp;c. It is, however, generally admitted,
that no substance ever employed equals in efficacy, or certainty, the <em>Cantharis
Vesicatoria</em>, the common blistering, or Spanish fly; and whose
effects may serve to illustrate the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> of this class of remedies.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>By the application of a <em>Blister</em>, the extreme blood vessels are excited
into increased action, by which inflammation is occasioned, and the exhalants
made to pour out a thin serous fluid which separates the cuticle from
the true skin, and forms a vesicle or blister.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this simple view of the subject it will appear evident, that blisters
may produce their salutary effects by several different modes of operation;
by a just estimate of which the practitioner will be enabled to reconcile the
discordant opinions which have been delivered upon the subject, and to
employ these agents with greater satisfaction and advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Blisters may act—</p>

<p class='c047'>1. <span class='sc'>As Derivatives</span>, i. e. <em>by producing a derivation of the circulation from
the inflamed and engorged vessels of the neighbouring organs to the blistered
surface</em>. This mode of operation was long overlooked by the physicians,
who ascribed all the beneficial effects of a blister to the evacuation
which it produced, while the humoral pathologist, moreover,
considered the matter so discharged to be of a morbific nature. That
such agents owe their salutary tendency to causes independent of
their powers as evacuants, is at once rendered evident by the relief
which they afford, when used only as Rubefacients.</p>

<p class='c047'>2. <span class='sc'>As Evacuants</span>—<em>by occasioning an effusion of Fluids</em>. In this case the
vesicated part may be considered in the light of a new excretory organ,
the formation of which requires the establishment of a new current
or determination of blood; so long as the discharge continues,
so long will there be an especial demand of blood in the blistered part,
and a consequent derivation of the circulation from the inflamed and
engorged vessels of the neighbouring organs.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c015'><sup>[174]</sup></a> The nature of the
fluid effused is at first serous, but after some time it becomes purulent,
and this stage of its operation must be considered as, by far, the most
beneficial; hence the great advantages derived from a “<em>perpetual
blister</em>.”</p>

<p class='c047'>3. <span class='sc'>As General Stimulants</span>, <em>by raising the vigour of the circulation</em>.<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c015'><sup>[175]</sup></a>
That Blisters have such a tendency there exist too many proofs to
allow us to doubt. Hence in fevers they frequently prove valuable
auxiliaries, but since the application of any stimulus, in such diseases,
must be regulated by the degree of excitement, it is evident that they
can only be made with success in particular stages; this simple fact
will at once explain the cause of that want of unanimity in Physicians
with respect to the value of blisters in febrile diseases. Rush
considered that there was one particular period, in the course of a
continued fever, intermediate between its stage of high excitement
and the appearance of a collapse, in which blisters will generally
produce unequivocal good effects, and to this he gave the name of
the <em>Blistering point</em>.</p>

<p class='c047'>4. <span class='sc'>As Antispasmodics.</span>—<em>Relieving pain through the medium of Contiguous
Sympathy.</em> This effect would frequently appear to be independent of
the operations above enumerated; a similar principle seems to exist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>with regard to the <em>pain</em> excited by blisters, which may also be applied
to the explanation of the advantages derived from them in several
diseases. It has long been remarked that, by exciting one pain we
may often relieve another, and hence blisters afford relief in tooth-ache,
and other painful affections. Epilepsy and Hysteria, arising
from irritation, have been removed by such applications, apparently
from their exciting powers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It remains for us to make a few observations upon the abuse of these
remedies, for, notwithstanding the popular adage that “<em>Blisters are always
safe things</em>,” that “<em>if they do no good, they can do no harm</em>,” they will be
found, like all other potent applications, capable of producing much mischief
when directed by unskilful hands. In stages of high vascular excitement
in the pulmonary organs, blisters have increased the irritation
they were designed to allay, and in some cases have promoted a tendency
to effusion; in the treatment of acute Hydrocephalus the common practice
of blistering the head appears very questionable, and has too often, I
am well persuaded, accelerated the fatal termination, by increasing the
disposition to serous effusion.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>ISSUES (<em>Fonticuli</em>) and <span class='sc'>Setons</span> (<em>Setacea</em><a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c015'><sup>[176]</sup></a>).</h4>

<p class='c018'>The effects of these processes bear a strong analogy to those which are
produced by Vesicatories; they are, however, more permanent, and are
on that account better adapted to the relief of those chronic affections
which would seem to require a remedy of long continued influence. In
pulmonary affections, for instance, a seton in the side is frequently attended
with very considerable benefit. The popular belief in humoral pathology,
which continues to influence the mass of mankind, has perhaps assigned
to these remedies a greater share of credit than that to which they are
really entitled, but it must still be acknowledged that when an ulcer
having existed a great length of time, is healed or <em>dried up</em>, or any constitutional
discharge is suddenly checked, the health may become affected.
In such cases the establishing a discharge by means of an Issue is undoubtedly
a safe, and often a beneficial operation.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>III. OF CHEMICAL REMEDIES.</h3>

<p class='c018'>There is no principle in physiology better established than that which
considers vitality as a power engaged in continual conflict with the physical,
chemical, and mechanical laws, to which every species of inanimate
matter is invariably subject. Every phenomenon of the living
body might be advanced in illustration and support of this general position.
The animal machine is constantly surrounded and assailed by
agents, whose elective attractions for the principles of which it consists,
are so numerous and energetic, that its decomposition would inevitably
and speedily result, were not the adhesion of its molecules maintained by
the conservative influence of a superior power. The compositions and decompositions
which manifest themselves in the elaborate operations of chylification,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>sanguification, and secretion, are carried on by agencies totally distinct
from those which govern the combinations of inert matter, and must be
investigated upon principles essentially different. How then, it may be
asked, can a medicinal substance be brought to act <em>chemically</em> upon the
<em>living</em> body? Notwithstanding the general proposition, that the animal
processes to which we have alluded, are governed by laws peculiar to life,
yet it must be admitted that such processes are occasionally influenced,<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c015'><sup>[177]</sup></a>
modified, and controlled by powers strictly chemical in their operation;
although in some cases it will be seen that such effects afford only apparent
exceptions to the general law: for several of the remedies whose operations
have been regarded as purely chemical, exert their influence on
parts which cannot be strictly considered under the control of the living
principle; of which <em>Antacids</em>, and certain <em>Antidotes</em> and <em>Antiseptics</em>, to be
hereafter explained, may be considered as examples: in like manner will
cataplasms of acetic acid hasten the exfoliation of carious bone; a practice
which has lately been employed with much success in the Infirmary
at Gloucester. Upon the same principle alkaline applications may be
made to dissolve coagulated blood; suppose, for the sake of illustration,
that the bladder should become filled with coagulum through hemorrhage
from the prostate gland, and that the most serious consequences were to
be apprehended from the distention; in such an emergency, a dilute and
tepid solution of potass, if injected through the catheter, might prove eminently
serviceable; although such a practice would require the utmost
skill for its safe direction, since the removal of the plug, thus afforded by
Nature to the bleeding vessel, might be followed by an immediate return
of active hemorrhage. On the contrary, other agents destroy the vitality
of the organ before they can produce any change in the matter of
which it is composed, as the action of <em>Escharotics</em> will clearly demonstrate.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>
  <h4 class='c034'>REFRIGERANTS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Substances which directly diminish the force of the circulation, and reduce
the heat of the body, without occasioning any diminution of sensibility
or nervous energy.</p>

<p class='c007'>These remedies may be considered either as external and local, or as internal
and general. In the first case, there will not be much difficulty in
substantiating their claims to be considered <em>Chemical Agents</em>, but in the
latter case, the theory of their operation is unsatisfactory and obscure;
and even the facts which are adduced to establish the existence of such a
class of remedies, are of a very problematical character.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Topical Refrigerants.</span> In the case of external inflammation, refrigeration
may be produced by the application of cold substances, such as
water, ice, or certain saline solutions, or by the abstraction of heat by
means of evaporation, which is very effectually accomplished by the use
of lotions composed of spirit or ether. By these methods we are capable
of directly diminishing the activity of the vessels of the part; thus, in
burns and scalds, the pain is instantly relieved, and the inflammation effectually
reduced.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Internal Refrigerants.</span> There are certain saline substances which,
by undergoing a rapid solution, and acquiring an increased capacity for
caloric, produce a diminution of temperature, and if this takes place in
the stomach, the sensation of cold which it will produce is equivalent to a
partial abstraction of stimulus; which, being extended by sympathy to
the heart, occasions a transient reduction in the force of the circulation,
and by this, or by a similar sympathetic affection, causes a sensation of
cold over the whole body; in this manner Dr. Murray explains the refrigerant
operation of nitre, which after all is of a very doubtful nature.
We shall perhaps not feel much difficulty in accepting this theory, and in
allowing that general refrigerant effects may be temporarily produced, by
occasioning an impression of cold upon the stomach. The theory which
is proposed to explain the refrigerant operation of vegetable acids and
certain other substances, and which we have now to consider, is derived
from those chemical views respecting animal heat, in which the consumption
of oxygen in the act of respiration is considered the principal source.
Dr. Murray,<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c015'><sup>[178]</sup></a> who has given a luminous exposition of this theory, says
“it is established by numerous experiments and observations, that the
quantity of oxygen consumed in the lungs is materially influenced by the
nature of the ingesta received into the stomach. When the food and
drink are composed of substances which contain a small proportion of
oxygen, it is known that the consumption of oxygen in the lungs is increased,
and this even in a short time after the aliment has been received;
thus Mr. Spalding, the celebrated diver, observed, that whenever he used
a diet of animal food, or drank spirituous liquors, he consumed in a much
shorter time the oxygen of the atmospheric air in his diving-bell; and
therefore he had learned from experience to confine himself to a vegetable
diet, and to water for drink, when following his profession.”<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c015'><sup>[179]</sup></a> During digestion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>too, it was established by the experiments of Lavoisier and
Seguin, that a larger proportion of oxygen than usual is consumed.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is known, that the animal temperature is derived from the consumption
of oxygen gas by respiration; and, that an increase in that
consumption will occasion a greater evolution of caloric in the system,
and consequently an increase of temperature in the body, while a diminution
in the consumption of oxygen will have an opposite effect. If, then,
when the temperature of the body is morbidly increased, we introduce
into the stomach substances containing a large proportion of oxygen, especially
in a loose state of combination, we may succeed in reducing the
general temperature. This we accomplish in part by a vegetable diet,
but still more effectually by the free use of the <em>Acids</em>. The vegetable
acids in particular, which are found by experience to be the best refrigerants,
are readily acted upon by the digestive powers, and assimilated with
the food; and as the large quantity of oxygen which they contain is already
in a concrete state, little sensible heat can be produced by the combination
of that element with the other principles of the food. The
nutritious matter which is received into the blood, containing thus a larger
proportion of oxygen than usual, will be disposed to abstract less of
it from the air in the lungs, and consequently less caloric will be evolved;
the temperature of the body will be reduced; and this, again operating as
a reduction of stimulus, will lessen the number and force of the contractions
of the heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such is the philosophical web which chemical ingenuity has wove for
us,—the device is beautiful, but the fabric will be found too frail to endure
the touch. The experiments of Dr. Crawford, in proof of the chemical
origin of animal heat, are highly ingenious and plausible, but it is now
generally admitted that the temperature of animals depends upon the living
principle<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c015'><sup>[180]</sup></a> which animates them, and that although the absorption of
oxygen, in the act of respiration, may directly contribute something to its
production, yet that its chief action is that of serving as a stimulus to the
living power in generating it; for, as Sir Gilbert Blane<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c015'><sup>[181]</sup></a> remarks, oxygen
plays an interesting and active part as an exciting power throughout
all nature, both animate and inanimate. If the heat of the body depended
on respiration alone, any one might, by a voluntary effort of quick,
deep, and prolonged respiration, increase the temperature of his body at
will; the effect also of the emotions of the mind, in generating both heat
and cold, adds Sir Gilbert, is proof sufficient of temperature depending on
a vital, and not on a chemical cause.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>ANTACIDS:</h4>

<p class='c018'>Remedies which obviate acidity in the stomach, by combining with the
acid, and neutralizing it.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the most decided instance of chemical action which occurs in
the history of medicinal operations. We have an acid whose presence
excites morbid symptoms in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>, and these are immediately removed
by the administration of any one of those substances which are
capable of forming a natural compound with the acid in question, <em>out of
the body</em>, and the same proportions are required in both cases for saturation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>If a carbonated alkali be employed, the same disengagement of carbonic
acid takes place in the stomach as would occur in the laboratory,
and a new compound is produced, whose operation varies according to
the chemical nature of the substance employed; thus, the salt which
magnesia forms with the acid in the stomach proves slightly purgative,
while that which lime produces under similar circumstances is distinguished
by an opposite property.</p>

<h4 class='c034'><span class='sc'>ANTILITHICS and LITHONTHRYPTICS.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Antilithics</span><a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c015'><sup>[182]</sup></a> are remedies which have the power of preventing the
formation of those mechanical deposites from the urine, which give origin
to calculous concretions; and may belong either to the class of Vital, or
Chemical Agents.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lithonthryptics</span><a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c015'><sup>[183]</sup></a> are those medicines which, by a chemical operation,
are capable of dissolving calculous concretions.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been already shewn, while treating the subject of Diuretics, that
certain substances, when internally administered, are capable of passing
the barriers of digestion, and of entering the circulation; and that, moreover,
these bodies may be again separated by the secretory vessels of the
kidneys, and be ejected from the body in the urine. It cannot therefore
be contended, that the urinary calculus is placed beyond the sphere of direct
medicinal influence, nor can any argument, founded upon the alleged
incompatibility of chemical and vital action, be fairly maintained in this
case; for the urinary calculus, as well as the urine itself,<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c015'><sup>[184]</sup></a> may very justly
be considered as extraneous to the living body. The existence of such a
class of remedies as that of Lithonthryptics being thus established, we
have to consider the mode and possible extent of their operation in the different
varieties of the disease, which they are thus calculated to palliate

<p class='c007'>Besides the above ingredients, which appear to be essential to healthy
urine, Dr. Prout observes that in different diseases it may contain Albumen,
Fibrin, and the red particles of the blood; Nitric acid; various acids,
which are found to be modifications of the Lithic; Oxalic acid; Benzoic
acid; Carbonic acid;<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c015'><sup>[190]</sup></a> Xanthic Oxide; Cystic Oxide; Sugar; Bile; and
Pus.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be necessary in this place to make a few observations upon the
nature and habitudes of those principles, which are more immediately active
in the production of calculi—</p>

<p class='c047'>1. <em>Urea</em> is a principle peculiar to urine, and must be regarded as a result
of the action of the kidneys upon some of the constituents of
the blood, perhaps, as Dr. Prout suggests, upon its albuminous
matter. For a long time it was regarded as the peculiar principle
upon which the colour and other sensible qualities of the urine depended;
Berzelius however has corrected this fallacy, and considers
that the Lactic acid, and its accompanying animal matters,
are the bodies which impart to this fluid the characteristic smell
and colour which distinguish it.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c015'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c047'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>2. <em>Lithic</em>, or <em>Uric<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c015'><sup>[192]</sup></a> Acid</em>. As this principle is not found in the blood,
but is constantly present in healthy urine, it follows that it must be
generated by the action of the kidneys. M. Majendie<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c015'><sup>[193]</sup></a> has lately
endeavoured to prove that its secretion depends upon the <em>Azote</em> received
in alimentary substances, and for the following reasons, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i>
1. Azote is a component part of <em>Lithic Acid</em><a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c015'><sup>[194]</sup></a>—2. Those persons
who use a large portion of animal food, and fermented liquors, are
liable to calculous disorders—3. When animals are confined to
food which contains no Azote, no Lithic acid is formed—but of this
anon.—Berzelius and other animal chemists have supposed that
this acid exists in urine in a free state; but Dr. Prout, whose arguments
appear very satisfactory and decisive, is of opinion that it
is always in combination with ammonia (<em>Lithate of Ammonia</em>),
from which however it is very easily separated by the addition of
any acid, even the carbonic, in the form of a red powder. It moreover
appears to be susceptible of several important modifications,
with which it behoves the pathologist to be acquainted; the profession
is greatly indebted to the ingenuity and industry of Dr.
Prout for some very essential additions to our knowledge, respecting
the habitudes of <em>Lithic acid</em> with different bodies.</p>

<p class='c047'><em>Erythric Acid.</em> When nitric acid diluted with about an equal
bulk of water, is poured upon pure lithic acid, and a moderate heat
is applied, an effervescence takes place, and the lithic acid is dissolved;
if we then concentrate this solution by a gentle evaporation,
we obtain transparent colourless crystals, which have been
found to constitute a peculiar acid, to which M. Brugnatelli has
given the name of <em>Erythric acid</em>.</p>

<p class='c047'><em>Purpuric Acid.</em> Dr. Prout has discovered that if into a strong
solution of the above crystals in water, whilst boiling hot, we carefully
drop some pure ammonia, the solution acquires a beautiful
purple<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c015'><sup>[195]</sup></a> colour, and crystals of <em>purpurate of ammonia</em> speedily begin
to form and subside. If these crystals are treated by means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>of potass and sulphuric acid, pure <em>Purpuric acid</em> is obtained in the
form of a yellowish, or cream-coloured powder.</p>

<p class='c047'>3. <em>The Phosphates.</em> As the Phosphoric acid and its compounds perform
an important part in the generation of calculi, their origin<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c015'><sup>[196]</sup></a>
and history demand particular attention from the chemist. The
Phosphoric acid frequently exists in the urine in a free state, when
it would appear to act, like any other acid, as a precipitant of the
Lithic acid; this however is not the circumstance that renders its
presence formidable; it is to the abundance of its compounds that
we are to look for mischief. In healthy urine the phosphoric acid
appears to exist in union with soda and ammonia, and partly with
lime and magnesia; the latter salts being retained in solution by
an excess of acid; but the proportion of these bodies is liable to
considerable variation.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c015'><sup>[197]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Having thus briefly noticed those particular points in the chemistry of
the subject with which the therapeutic principles are more immediately
connected, we shall be better prepared to examine and appreciate the
several plans of treatment which have been proposed for the prevention,
cure, or palliation of calculous disorders; and here the subject naturally
divides itself into two parts; the one comprehending the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i>
of Antilithics, or those remedies which prevent or correct the calculous
diathesis; the other, explaining the solvent action of Lithonthryptics over
concretions already formed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The line of demarcation by which healthy and morbid urine are separated,
is so slight that it is difficult to define its limits; nor would the circumstance
appear to be materially important, for the boundary is daily exceeded,
not only with impunity, but even without our consciousness of the
event; and Dr. Prout has accordingly denominated such occasional deviations,
the “<em>Sediments of Health</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The same enlightened author considers that mechanical deposites from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the urine, although composed of the same general ingredients, may, in a
pathological point of view, be conveniently divided into three classes, viz.
<em>Pulverulent</em> or <em>Amorphous Sediments</em>; 2. <em>Crystalline Sediments</em>, usually denominated
gravel; and 3. <em>Solid Concretions</em>, or calculi formed by the aggregation
of these latter sediments. The first of these may be passed
over, as unconnected with the present subject; the latter however constitutes
an essential object of research; for a complete acquaintance with
the chemical history of calculi can alone furnish the true indications of
cure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scheele,<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c015'><sup>[198]</sup></a> with whom the inquiry originated, conceived that every calculus
consisted of a peculiar concrete acid, soluble in alkaline lixivia, and
which Morveau denominated the <em>Lithic Acid</em>; but the subsequent researches
of Fourcroy, Vauquelin, Wollaston, Pearson, Henry, Brande,
Marcet, and Prout, have demonstrated the existence of <em>several</em> bodies in
the composition of urinary calculi, viz. <em>Lithic Acid</em>; <em>Phosphate of Lime</em>;
<em>Ammoniaco-magnesian Phosphate</em>; <em>Oxalate of Lime</em>; <em>Cystic Oxide</em>;<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c015'><sup>[199]</sup></a> and
<em>Xanthic Oxide</em>;<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c015'><sup>[200]</sup></a> to which may be added an <em>animal cementing ingredient</em>.
The varieties of calculi produced by the combination or intermixture of
these ingredients, are represented in the following Tabular Arrangement.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Let us now inquire into the circumstances under which the several substances
enumerated in the foregoing table, are found to be deposited; and
first of the <em>Lithic acid Diathesis</em>. It has been already stated, that the
lithic acid exists in the urine in combination with ammonia, so as to be
held in solution under ordinary circumstances; if however any free acid
be generated, the lithic acid is immediately precipitated, giving rise to the
appearance so well known under the name of <em>red gravel</em>; from this view
of the subject the lithic acid deposite must be considered as arising, not
from the excess of that substance in the urine, but from a decomposition
of the compounds into which it enters by the agency of a free acid. M.
Majendie is therefore incorrect in attributing its appearance to the quantity
of azote in the ingesta; an opinion which has been very ably controverted
by Dr. Philip, in a paper published in the sixth volume of the Medical
Transactions. It appears, moreover, that whatever tends to disturb
the process of digestion, by favouring the production of acid, may be considered
as the exciting cause of the lithic deposites; especially where the
cutaneous functions are imperfectly performed; for Dr. Philip is of opinion,
that the precipitating acid, in a healthy state of the system, is thrown
off by the skin; and he supposes that even when generated in excess, it
may be diverted to the surface of the body by merely increasing the insensible
perspiration. The medical treatment of the lithic diathesis is
thus rendered simple and satisfactory; and if the opinion of Dr. Prout be
true, that at least two-thirds of the whole number of calculi originate from
lithic acid, the extreme importance of the subject is too apparent to require
comment. Remedies, medicinal and dietetic, that are capable of
correcting dyspeptic symptoms, such as slight bitters,<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c015'><sup>[201]</sup></a> will doubtless prove
valuable resources; while all those agents which have a tendency to correct
and regulate the insensible perspiration, will necessarily fall under
the head of anti-lithic remedies. Mr. Copland Hutchison, in a paper
which has been published in the Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical
Society, has shewn a comparative rarity of calculous disorders in British
seamen. Can the quantity of muriate of soda taken with their food,
from its stimulating influence upon the cutaneous functions, be considered
as affording a plausible explanation of this fact? The <em>Phosphatic Diathesis</em>
seems to be accompanied with considerable derangement of the chylo-poietic
viscera, and Dr. Prout very justly remarks, what I have frequently
observed, that the stools are extremely unnatural; as the phosphates are
retained in solution by an excess of acid, it would appear as if an alkaline
principle was occasionally developed, and it is not unreasonable to suppose
that this may be sometimes derived from bilious regurgitations;<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c015'><sup>[202]</sup></a> in
some cases, the alkali is derived from the spontaneous decomposition of
urine itself, especially where the bladder has lost its <em>governing power</em>,<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c015'><sup>[203]</sup></a> as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>from some injury<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c015'><sup>[204]</sup></a> of the spine; or from some local affection of the bladder
or prostate gland; wherever the urine undergoes an incipient process
of decomposition, ammonia will be generated, and an <em>ammoniaco-magnesian
phosphate</em><a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c015'><sup>[205]</sup></a> be immediately precipitated: hence in cases where the
bladder is unable to discharge its contents, this deposite is very apt to
take place, as in diseases in the prostate; and this explains the reason
why the triple phosphates are so frequently formed in elderly people, who
cannot wholly evacuate their bladder.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will appear evident from these cursory observations, that some varieties
of Calculi will be influenced by acids, and others by alkalies, and that
the exhibition of such remedies will be liable to palliate, or to aggravate
the symptoms, according to the character and composition of the offending
calculus, and according to the prevailing diathesis of the patient; as
a general rule to direct us in the chemico-medical treatment of these cases,
Dr. Marcet states, that “<em>Whenever the lithic acid predominates, the alkalies<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c015'><sup>[206]</sup></a>
are the appropriate remedies, but that when the calcareous or magnesian salts
prevail, the acids are to be resorted to</em>.” But if it be asked how we are to
discover the nature of the calculous affection, so as to direct the suitable
remedy? the reply is obvious—by an examination of the sediment deposited
by the recent urine, or by an analysis of the small fragments which
are frequently voided with it; the Phosphates subside from the urine as a
<em>white</em>, lithic acid, generally, as a <em>red</em> deposit; and since the phosphates
are held in solution in the urine by an excess of acid, it is evident that
whenever such acidity is diminished by the hand of Nature or art, a white
sabulous deposit will ensue; hence, says Mr. Brande, it occurs in the
urine of persons who drink soda water, or take magnesia; the remedy of
such a deposit, when it takes place habitually, is a course of acidulous
medicines; on the contrary, since <em>lithic acid</em> is precipitated by the acids,
alkalies are naturally suggested for the prevention of that deposit. In
the <em>compound</em> calculi, acids and alkalies may be equally injurious or beneficial,
for since these bodies are composed of a variety of ingredients, the
action of any one solvent must be partial, and may convert the smooth
calculus into a rough and highly irritating body, or vice versa. In the <em>alternating</em>
calculi it may be judicious to exhibit these remedies alternately,
as the symptoms of the case and the deposit of the urine may indicate.
After all, however, the solvent powers of Lithonthryptic remedies must
be very limited, and in advanced cases we can never expect to procure
more than palliation. With respect to the agency of these different remedies,
as <em>Antilithics</em>, I would observe, that while experience bears us out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>in confiding in the production of certain chemical effects from their use,
we must not forget that much is to be effected by their judicious administration
as <em>vital</em> agents: and it will be hereafter my duty to point out the
many advantages that may be obtained, by combining in one formula,
medicines which individually belong to each class.</p>

<p class='c007'>Independent of any chemical effect, alkaline substances are found by
daily experience to allay the morbid irritability of the urinary organs in a
manner not yet explained; alkalies may also prove <em>generally</em> serviceable
in these disorders, by acting immediately upon the digestive organs, for
the disposition of forming calculi is always, more or less, accompanied
with the indications of deranged digestion; and it is probable that the first
link of the series of actions, which cause this disposition, has its origin in
the stomach.</p>

<p class='c007'>The alkaline carbonates are found to answer as effectually as the pure
alkalies, and they have the advantage of being less liable to disagree with
the stomach. Mr. Hatchett has proposed the carbonate of magnesia, in
doses of ℈j to ʒj, as a valuable substitute for alkaline remedies in cases of
lithic calculi; but as its insolubility must render its absorption equivocal,
the beneficial operation of the substance must principally depend upon its
neutralizing any excess of acid in the primæ viæ, and in this way there
can be no doubt of its lithonthryptic agency; “but,” says Dr. Marcet,
“such is the tendency which the public has to over-rate the utility of a
new practice, or to take a mistaken view of its proper application, that
there is every reason to believe that the use of magnesia has of late years
become a frequent source of evil in calculous complaints.” Lime-water
has been also recommended for the purpose of fulfilling the same indications,
and as not being liable to produce that irritability of stomach which
frequently attends the long continued use of the fixed alkalies; besides
which, some chemists have maintained that it exerts a peculiar solvent
power over the cementing animal matter of the concretion, and thereby
destroys its cohesion.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c015'><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Where an acid is indicated, the <em>Muriatic</em> will in my judgment be found
as convenient and effectual as any that can be administered. Mr. Brande
proposes <em>Cream of Tartar</em> for this purpose; upon this point I differ with
him, for this salt, to say the least of it, is questionable in its mode of operation;
for although its first impression upon the stomach is that of an acid,
the subsequent processes of digestion decompose it, and eliminate its base,
which being absorbed acts upon the urinary organs as an alkali. I have
seen a white sabulous deposit, consisting of the Phosphates, in the urine
of persons after the constant use of <em>Imperial</em> as a beverage, which I am at
a loss to explain upon any other principle. Sir Gilbert Blane has also
very satisfactorily shewn, that a fixed alkali produces the same effect upon
the urinary organs whether it be exhibited alone, or in combination with
citric acid; in this latter case the salt undoubtedly undergoes a decomposition
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in transitu</span></i>, as I have more fully explained under the consideration of
Diuretics, (<em>page 94</em>.) During an alterative course of Lithonthryptic remedies
it may be beneficial to interpose occasionally a purgative medicine,
but we must not combine it with the lithonthryptic, at least, if we wish this
latter medicine to reach the urinary passages; for it is a law which I have
already attempted to establish (<em>see page 94</em>), that <em>Catharsis suspends the
process of alimentary absorption</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>There remains to be considered another mode of applying a solvent, and
which would seem on the first view of the subject to be full of promise,—that
of injecting the proposed menstruum into the bladder. Unfortunately,
however, the irritable state of this organ will generally preclude the possibility
of preserving the menstruum, for a sufficient length of time, in contact
with the calculus to accomplish any material solution; nor am I
aware that any case, in favour of such a practice, stands recorded. An
ingenious and novel application of the powers of Electro-chemistry has
been lately<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c015'><sup>[208]</sup></a> proposed by M M. Prevost and Dumas, as capable of affording
means for the solution of the calculus within the bladder; the suggestion
is highly plausible, and ought not to be hastily rejected without trial.
Could the functions of the part be protected against the influence of so
powerful an agent, it is evident that, by a galvanic battery of sufficient intensity,
a calculus composed of alkaline or earthy salts might be transferred
from the bladder by the simple introduction of a double sound, communicating
on one hand with the calculus, and, on the other, with two vessels
filled with water, in which are plunged the opposite poles of a galvanic apparatus.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c015'><sup>[209]</sup></a>
This arrangement would transfer the acid constituents into the
vessel connected with the <em>positive</em> end, and the bases into that of the <em>negative</em>
end. So far, however, as the experiments have hitherto been carried,
this degree of galvanic operation would seem to excite too much irritation
in the bladder to be admissible; but it still offers a resource of an apparently
more practicable nature. This consists in giving to the calculus a tendency
to crumble from the slightest force; such a friability, in short, as
shall render it easily broken into pieces sufficiently small to be evacuated
through the urethra, especially by the aid of dilating that passage, an operation
upon which much has lately been said and written. A fusible calculus
from the human subject was submitted to the action of a pile, consisting
of 120 pairs of plates, for twelve hours in succession. The platinum
wires, constituting the poles, were placed in contact with the calculus,
about six or eight lines distant from each other, and the whole plunged in
a vessel filled with pure water. During the galvanic action, the bases and
phosphoric acid first arrived at their respective poles, then re-entered into
combination, when the salt thus reformed was precipitated in the state of
powder. The calculus weighed 92 grains before the experiment, and was
reduced at its termination to 80. The process being continued, at the end
of sixteen hours it presented a mass of such friable texture as to be reduced
into small crystalline particles by the slightest pressure; the largest of
which did not exceed the size of a lentil, so that it might have easily passed
through the urethra.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to ascertain how far this decomposition could be effected in the
living body, the ingenious experimentalists selected a dog of rather large
size, into whose bladder they introduced a fusible calculus attached to a
sound, and between two conductors of platinum; the bladder was next
distended by injecting tepid water, and the apparatus subjected to galvanic
influence. After a little struggling, the animal became calm, and was
subjected to the operation during an hour. On removing the sound, the
calculus shewed unequivocal marks of decomposition. The same process
was repeated, night and morning, during six days, when the friability of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>the calculus rendered it impossible to continue the experiment. It had
lost weight in the same proportion as in the preceding trial. The bladder,
which was afterwards examined, exhibited no appearance of injury or disease.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c015'><sup>[210]</sup></a>
The authors assert that this organ does not suffer any inconvenience
from this more moderate degree of galvanic action, and suggest, as
a proof of the mildness of its influence, that we should immerse the tongue
in a vessel filled with water, in which a calculus is undergoing decomposition,
and it will be found that the tongue, which is far more sensible than
the bladder, will scarcely perceive the galvanic action, even when decomposition
is going on briskly. The authors add, that this process cannot
offer any advantage for the removal of those calculi which consist wholly
of <em>Uric acid</em>, or which contain a large proportion of it.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c015'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Medicines which are capable of preventing the ill effects of a poison;
or, of counteracting its fatal virulence.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is perhaps no subject upon which the credulity of mankind has
been so extravagantly exercised as on that of <span class='sc'>Poisons</span>; nor is there, certainly,
any class of remedies whose history has suffered so many vicissitudes
from the caprice of hypothesis, as that of <span class='sc'>Antidotes</span>.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c015'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is not my intention, on the present occasion,<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c015'><sup>[213]</sup></a> to enumerate the many
extraordinary virtues<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c015'><sup>[214]</sup></a> which credulity has, at different times, assigned to
such medicines; nor shall I consume the time of the reader by attempting
to expose the absurdity of those fearful powers with which ignorance,
terror, and imposture, have invested certain poisons,—a subtlety so extreme
as to defeat the most skilful caution, and a virulence so manageable
as to be capable of the most accurate graduation; so that while the former
attribute was believed to ensure their deadly operation, although exerted
through the most secret and least suspicious medium, as that of
gloves,<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c015'><sup>[215]</sup></a> tapers, or letters, the latter was said to enable the accomplished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>assassin to measure the allotted moments of his victim with the nicest
precision, and to occasion his death at any period that might best answer
the objects of the assassination.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c015'><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The abandonment of such notions may be considered as one among the
many advantages which have arisen to medicine, from the cultivation of
physiology.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without farther introduction, I shall proceed to the main object of this
work, and inquire how far a <em>chemical agent</em> may be capable of neutralizing,
or of decomposing, a poisonous substance in the human body; and
endeavour to ascertain the degree of confidence to which it may in each
particular case be entitled; equally important is it to learn, whether certain
<em>vital</em> agents may not be serviceable in cases of poisoning, either by
promoting the elimination of the poison, or by producing a state of the system
best calculated to resist its deleterious operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be safely asserted that we possess very few true antidotes; for
although several of the mineral poisons may be neutralized or decomposed
by various reagents, yet their destructive action is generally so rapid,
that the mischief is effected before any chemical changes can avail; and,
in other cases, the substances resulting from the chemical action, are as
poisonous as the original ingredients, as in the case of the decomposition
of <em>Corrosive Sublimate</em>, by the alkalies and earths, when the precipitated
oxide is as virulent as the original salt; while, under certain circumstances,
I suspect that the vital powers of the stomach are in direct opposition
to those changes and decompositions which so readily, and so uniformly,
take place in our laboratories. To <em>vital agents</em> then, the practitioner
must principally look for succour; but before we can establish any
general rules for the treatment of poisoning, it is essential to distinguish
between the different modes in which poisonous substances produce their
effects, or at least to determine the parts of the living system through
which they act; for it will be found, that each poison has its own <em>modus
operandi</em>, from which alone can be derived the particular indications of
cure.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hypotheses devised by the ancient physicians, to account for the
destructive powers of these substances, were principally derived from mechanical
notions respecting the supposed form of their particles, which
they imagined capable of lacerating and disuniting the animal fibres by
the sharpness of their spiculæ;<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c015'><sup>[217]</sup></a> it is however, now satisfactorily established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>that the action of a poison in the human stomach is very rarely, if
ever, <em>mechanical</em>; sometimes <em>chemical</em>; but for the most part <em>vital</em> in its
operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each of the three kingdoms of Nature furnishes a number of poisons,
the investigation of whose chemical properties and physiological actions,
and that of the symptoms to which their administration gives rise, the
lesions of structure which they occasion, and of the medical treatment
which they require, constitutes an elaborate branch of science designated
by the term <span class='sc'>Toxicology</span>, and of which I have more fully treated in my
work on Medical Jurisprudence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Poisons differ materially from each other, not only with respect to the
modes in which they produce their effects in relation to the several vital
organs, but with respect to their application; some of those, for instance,
which, if introduced into a wound, are speedily fatal, may be taken into
the stomach with complete impunity, as in the instance of the venom of
the viper and other snakes, which appears to exert no influence on the
stomach; others, on the contrary, display their deleterious action on the
stomach alone, such as caustic acids, and alkalies, corrosive sublimate, and
some chemical poisons; while others, again, are equally destructive whether
applied to the inner surface of the stomach, or to the lower intestines,
in the form of clyster, or even to the mucous membrane of the mouth or
nose; to the eye; to the vagina and orifice of the uterus, or to an abraded
portion of the skin. There is, moreover, a class of substances which may
be termed <em>Aerial</em> poisons, for they may exist in the state of gas, or be
held dissolved in the atmosphere, and be received by respiration, or by the
mucous membranes of the nose and throat; the saliva may also thus become
the medium for transferring various subtile poisons from the atmosphere
to the animal body; this is well illustrated by the fact of the transfer
of metallic influence, as related in the case of a gentleman in perfect
health who became salivated in consequence of sitting for one hour by the
side of a person who was in a state of mercurial ptyalism, in order to give
him a lesson in botany.</p>

<p class='c007'>It also deserves notice, that a poison acts with different degrees of force
and celerity in different parts of the same tissue; its absorption, for instance,
would appear to be energetic in proportion to the number of veins,<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c015'><sup>[218]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>although several apparent exceptions to this law might be adduced, and
it is evident that the plethoric state of the part with respect to its blood-vessels
has a considerable share in modifying the effects; this observation,
however, has no relation to those poisons which operate on the system
through the sympathetic communication of the nerves; Mr. Brodie, for
instance, found that the poison of bitter almonds acted more speedily when
applied to the tongue than when injected into the intestine, though the latter
presents a much better absorbing surface.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Foderé</em>, in the fourth volume of his <em>Medicine Legale</em>, arranges poisons
according to their action on the living system, and which, with a slight alteration
in the order of the classes, has been adopted by <em>Orfila</em>, and most
other writers on Toxicology. Poisons are thus reduced into six classes:
viz. 1. <span class='sc'>Corrosive</span> or <span class='sc'>Escharotic</span>, as the <em>Preparations of Mercury</em>, <em>Arsenic</em>,
<em>Antimony</em>, <em>Copper</em>, <em>Tin</em>, <em>Zinc</em>, <em>Silver</em>, <em>Gold</em>, and <em>Bismuth</em>; the <em>concentrated
Acids</em>, and <em>caustic Alkalies</em>, and <em>Earths</em>; <em>Cantharides</em>; <em>glass and
enamel powder</em>; <em>diamond dust</em>.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c015'><sup>[219]</sup></a> 2. <span class='sc'>Astringent Poisons</span>, of which the
<em>preparations of Lead</em> constitute the only species. 3. <span class='sc'>Acrid</span> or <span class='sc'>Rubefacient
Poisons</span>, which, with a few exceptions, are furnished by the vegetable
kingdom, as certain <em>drastic purgatives</em>, <em>Hellebore</em>, <em>Euphorbium</em>, &amp;c.
4. <span class='sc'>Narcotic Poisons</span>, <em>Opium</em>, <em>Henbane</em>, the <em>Cherry-laurel</em>, <em>Stramonium</em>, &amp;c.
5. <span class='sc'>Narcotico-Acrid</span>, embracing such articles as produce the united effects
of the two former, and which constitute some of the most deadly
poisons, as the <em>Ticunas</em>, <em>Nux-vomica</em>, <em>Belladonna</em>, <em>Tobacco</em>, <em>Hemlock</em>, <em>Digitalis</em>,
&amp;c. 6. <span class='sc'>Septic Poisons</span>, <em>contagious miasmata</em>, <em>putrid exhalations
from animal matter</em>, <em>Sulphuretted Hydrogen</em>, the <em>venom of the viper</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>The value of this classification has been very justly stated to consist in
its combining to a certain degree, the advantages of a pathological arrangement
with those of one founded on the basis of Natural History;
for, while it is strictly pathological, it at the same time distributes the different
poisons, with some few and unimportant exceptions, in an order
corresponding with that of their natural history. The First two classes,
for instance, present us with substances of a mineral origin; the Third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>and Fourth, with those which are chiefly of a vegetable nature; and the
Sixth, with objects principally belonging to the animal kingdom. The
importance of acknowledging a division, which has a reference to the organic
and inorganic kingdoms of Nature, is considerable in a chemical
point of view; for in enumerating the various experiments to be instituted
for the detection of poisons, we are thus enabled to bring together a connected
series of processes, nearly allied to, intimately connected with, and
in some respects mutually dependent upon, each other. At the same
time it must be acknowledged, that this classification has many defects
and some fallacies. In the first place, it has little or no reference to the
enlarged views of the modern physiologist, respecting the “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i>”
of Poisons; nor indeed is its construction susceptible of such modifications
and improvements, as can ever render its degree of perfection
progressive with the advancement of science. In the next place, the
classes are in many particulars ill defined, and indistinctly, if not erroneously,
divided. How questionable, for instance, are the boundaries which
separate <em>Corrosive</em> from <em>Acrid</em> poisons? the respective species, even, of
each class are, in many cases, less allied to each other, than are the great
divisions to which they are subordinate. As an exemplification of this
fact we have only to compare the physiological actions of <em>Arsenic</em> and
<em>Corrosive Sublimate</em>, both of which are arranged under the class of Corrosive
Poisons. The former of these substances undoubtedly occasions
death by being absorbed, and thus acting as a vital agent; the latter, by
its local action, as a caustic on the textures with which it immediately
comes into contact. In the same manner, if we examine the individual
actions of the different species composing the class of “<em>Acrid</em> Poisons,”
we shall discover the same want of uniformity; thus, the <em>Spurge Flax</em>,
and the <em>Iatropa Curcas</em>, act by occasioning a local inflammation, while the
<em>Hellebore</em>, being rapidly absorbed, exerts a fatal action on the nervous system,
and produces only a very slight inflammation. The class of Narcotic
Poisons is certainly more absolute in its definition, and more uniform
in its physiological affinities, and therefore less objectionable than the divisions
to which we have just alluded; but the propriety of the class
“<em>Narcotico-Acrid</em>” is by no means equally unexceptionable; indeed Orfila
himself questions it, “because the narcotic or sedative effects only follow
the previous excitement.” Some of the poisons of this division also are
rapidly absorbed, and act, through the medium of the circulation, on the
nervous system, without producing any local inflammation; while others,
on the contrary, merely act upon the extremities of the nerves, with which
they come in contact, and, without being absorbed, occasion death by a
species of sympathetic action.</p>

<p class='c007'>These few objections, and many more might be urged, are sufficient to
demonstrate the imperfection of the classification under consideration, and
which must render it wholly unavailable to the physician in the treatment
of cases of poisoning, who must derive his plan of cure from the physiological
action of the substance against which he has to contend; thus, for
instance, <em>Arsenic</em> and <em>Corrosive Sublimate</em> are both corrosive poisons, but so
materially do they differ from each other in their physiological actions
that, when swallowed, they will require for the preservation of the individual,
a very different system of treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'>For such reasons I have ventured to propose a new arrangement of
Poisons, which may furnish the practitioner with a general theorem for
the administration of Antidotes.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>The <em>First Class</em> of our arrangement comprehends such poisons as operate,
through the medium of the nerves, upon the organs immediately
subservient to life; in their application it is obvious that they cannot require
to be introduced into the stomach; they may convey their destructive
influence by an application to any part duly supplied with nerves, and
whose extremities are exposed to their action. It had been long admitted
that a poison might occasion death, by acting on the nerves of the stomach
and intestines without being absorbed; but to the experimental labours
of Mr. Brodie<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c015'><sup>[222]</sup></a> we are principally indebted for our present correct
views of the subject. The class admits of two important divisions, into
one comprehending those poisons which destroy the functions of the brain,
and into another, including those which direct their influence upon the
heart. We shall offer a few observations upon the facts which have suggested
such a division, and upon the practical advantages which may attend
its adoption.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was observed by <em>Bichât</em>, and the observation has been fully confirmed
by <em>Brodie</em>, that the influence of the brain is not <em>directly</em> necessary to the
action of the heart; and is <em>immediately</em> necessary to life, only because the
muscles of respiration owe their action to its influence.<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c015'><sup>[223]</sup></a> For when the
functions of the brain are destroyed, even when the head is removed, the
heart continues to contract for some time afterwards, and then ceases only
in consequence of the suspension of respiration, which is under the direct
influence of the brain. Assuming this as a fact, it will appear evident
that certain poisons may, by affecting the brain, so paralyse the muscles
of respiration as to occasion death by suffocation, and by such a mode of
operation I imagine that those substances, arranged in the former division
of my first class, prove mortal. <em>Mr. Brodie</em> accordingly found that, by
the administration of a large dose of alcohol to a rabbit, the pupils of its
eyes became dilated, the extremities convulsed, and the respiration laborious,
and that this latter function was gradually performed at longer and
longer intervals, and that it at length entirely ceased. Two minutes after
the apparent death of the animal, he opened the thorax, and found the
heart acting with moderate force and frequency, <em>circulating dark coloured
blood</em>; he then introduced a tube into the trachea, and produced artificial
respiration by inflating the lungs, and he found that by these means the
action of the heart might be kept up to the natural standard, as in an animal
from whom the head is removed. The same phenomena resulted
from the injection of two drops of the <em>Essential Oil of Bitter Almonds</em>, diffused
in half an ounce of water, into the rectum of a cat; and from the
application of the empyreumatic oil of <em>Tobacco</em> to the tongue, and rectum
of cats and dogs. Now it is obvious that the functions of the brain are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>immediately disordered by the influence of these poisons on the tongue,
stomach, and lower bowels of animals, so instantaneously, that it is impossible
absorption should have already taken place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the general proposition seems to be established, that the brain
is not <em>immediately</em> necessary to the action of the heart, yet it must not lead
us to the conclusion that the heart is therefore incapable of being affected
by violent impressions on the nervous system; the fact is quite otherwise,
for although the brain may be removed, and the circulation be nevertheless
maintained by artificial respiration, yet an injury of another kind inflicted
on the brain, may be followed by those immediately fatal consequences
which decapitation itself would not produce; thus is a blow on
the head commonly followed by syncope, and there are certain poisons
that would seem to act in the same manner, such is the <em>Infusion of Tobacco</em>,<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c015'><sup>[224]</sup></a>
which suspends the action of the heart long before the animal
ceases to respire, and kills by producing syncope, although in this latter
case it has been questioned whether the spinal marrow may not be primarily
affected, which has been shewn by recent experiments to have an intimate
relation with the action of the heart. Be this as it may, it is sufficiently
obvious, that the second division of the first class is sanctioned by
theory, and confirmed by experiment.</p>

<p class='c007'>We come now to speak of the Second Class,—of those Poisons which
enter the circulation, and act through that medium on the heart, brain,
and alimentary canal. These organs, however, are affected in very different
degrees by different poisons, or even by the same poisons, under
different circumstances. <em>Mr. Brodie</em> has shewn that vegetable poison,
although when introduced into the alimentary canal affect life, in consequence
of the nervous sympathy which subsists between these surfaces
and the common sensorium, yet, that the same poisons applied externally
to a wound, produce their effects exclusively through the medium of the
circulation, being conveyed to the brain only by mixing with the blood in
its vessels, and not by being conveyed through the lymphatics, for a ligature
upon the great blood-vessels prevents their producing deleterious effects;
whereas a ligature upon the thoracic duct, or general canal through
which all the absorbents pour their contents into the blood, does <em>not</em> in the
least retard or prevent the operation of the poison. There are also several
of the mineral poisons which, whether introduced into the stomach, or applied
externally to a wound, poison the animal in consequence of being
carried into the circulation. It had long been supposed that Arsenic occasioned
death by inflaming the stomach; but <em>Mr. Brodie</em> has very satisfactorily
shewn that its influence arises from its absorption, and that it
must be regarded rather as a <em>vital</em>, than as a <em>chemical</em> agent. In the first
place, he has found the inflammation of the stomach, in several cases, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>slight, that on a superficial examination it might have been easily overlooked;
and, in most of his experiments with Arsenic, death took place in
too short a time to be considered as the result of inflammation; and in the
next place, in whatever manner the poison is applied, whether <em>externally</em> to
a wound, or <em>internally</em> to the membrane of the stomach, the inflammation
is confined to the stomach and intestines; and, indeed, it is commonly
more violent, and even more immediate, when applied to a wound, than
when internally administered; and it also precedes any inflammation of
the wound. This important fact was proved by an experiment made by
Mr. Hunter and Sir Everard Home, and subsequently by the repeated investigations
of Mr. Brodie.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been just stated that after a poison has found its way into the circulation,
it expends its virulence upon some particular organs. In some
cases this is much more striking than in others. The preparations of
<em>Baryta</em>, and of <em>Tartarized Antimony</em>, attack the heart, and occasion death
by syncope. <em>Arsenic</em> is less definite in its action, it influences both the
brain and the heart, but with different degrees of force in different cases,
so that it is often difficult to ascertain which of these organs is the first to
fail in its functions. <em>Hydro-cyanic Acid</em> is absorbed, and destroys life by its
action upon the nervous system, whose energies it would seem to extinguish
without any ostensible injury to the respiration and circulation; for
in all those animals which were killed by it in the experiments of <em>Orfila</em>,
<em>Brodie</em>, and others, the heart was found acting regularly, and circulating
dark-coloured blood; and in some cases, this phenomenon was visible for
many minutes after the animal was in other respects apparently dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some substances would seem to direct their powers to various parts of
the alimentary canal; and the appearance so produced might be mistaken
for the effects of the local action of the poison, had they not been
clearly proved by experiment to have arisen from an application addressed
through the medium of the circulation; thus is inflammation of the <em>primæ
viæ</em> induced by the contact of Arsenic with an external surface of the
body!</p>

<p class='c011'>The <em>Third Class</em> of my arrangement includes those poisons which enter
the circulation, and, through that medium, expend their influence upon
the spinal marrow, without <em>directly</em> involving the functions of the brain.
<em>M. Majendie</em>, in the year 1809, submitted to the first class of the French
Institute a series of experiments which had conducted him to the extraordinary
result above stated. He found that an entire class of vegetables
(the <em>bitter Strychnus</em>) possesses this singular property.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <em>Fourth Class</em> comprehends all those substances which destroy life
by a local action upon the alimentary canal, not by any impression upon
their nerves, but by simply inducing a fatal lesion in the membranes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through one or more of the above modes of operation all poisons may
be said to produce their fatal effects. In some cases a poisonous substance
will be found to act in several different ways; thus, the <em>Nightshade</em>
is evidently absorbed, carried into the circulation, and is enabled,
through that medium to act upon the brain; at the same time it exerts a
local action upon the stomach, although less violent than that occasioned
by the acrid poisons; it moreover would appear, upon some occasions, to
act directly through the medium of the nerves, like those substances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>which have been received in our first class, or else, how shall we explain
the fact of the pupil of the eye becoming permanently dilated by the contact
of the <em>Belladonna</em> with the tunica conjunctiva? It would appear
therefore that this plant unites within itself all the three great modes of
action, upon which I have just attempted to establish a physiological arrangement
of Poisons. So again, <em>Corrosive Sublimate</em>, although placed in
the fourth division, as being a substance which destroys by inflicting local
mischief, is nevertheless capable of being absorbed. The embarrassments,
however, which might be supposed to arise from this double mode of operation,
are of but trifling importance. It is to the primary operation of a
poison to which we are to direct our attention, the subsequent effects are
less important in as much as they are more capable of being controlled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having thus offered a summary of our present views respecting the
physiological action of Poisons, we are prepared to lay down a general
plan of treatment, which, it will be seen, can only be successful when conducted
on principles strictly conformable with the just notions which the
preceding experiments have so satisfactorily established.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where a poisonous substance has, either through accident or design,
found its way into the alimentary canal, three important indications are,
if possible, to be fulfilled; and under these heads I shall offer such observations
as may serve to instruct the practitioner in the philosophy of the general
treatment, reserving the details to be observed in that of each poison,
for more particular notice in a subsequent part of the work, where the
history of these substances will be individually considered. The indications
to which I allude are the following, viz.</p>

<h5 class='c044'>1. <em>The immediate ejectment of the poison from the body, by the operation of vomiting and purging.</em></h5>

<p class='c018'>Whatever may be the nature of the poison, we should endeavour with
all possible expedition, to eject it from the body; and upon the promptness
with which this is effected, the safety of the patient will generally
depend; for the dangerous effects of such substances advance in a very
increasing ratio, with the time they remain in contact with a living surface.
A question may arise, whether in some cases it would not be judicious
to attempt in the first instance the neutralization or decomposition of
the poison; where a mineral acid, or a caustic alkali has been swallowed,
it would undoubtedly be right to neutralize, and dilute it, as soon as possible,
and then to excite vomiting, which may be advantageously effected
by thrusting the finger down the throat, or by tickling the internal fauces
with a feather: where an emetic is at hand, whatever may be its nature,
it should be promptly given, but if circumstances will allow us the opportunity
of selection, <em>Antimony</em>, <em>Ipecacuanha</em>, &amp;c. should be rejected, and <em>Sulphate
of Zinc</em>, or <em>Sulphate of Copper</em>, for several reasons, be preferred; in
the first place they do not require much dilution<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c015'><sup>[225]</sup></a> for their action, a circumstance
of no small importance in the treatment of poisons that act by
being absorbed; in the next place, they are extremely expeditious, a dose
of fifteen or twenty grains producing almost instantaneous vomiting, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>exciting that previous stage of nausea which so frequently characterises
other emetics, and which occasions a state of the vascular system
highly favourable to the function of absorption, (as I have so fully explained
at page 86, &amp;c.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The practice of emptying the stomach by means of a syringe, as proposed
by Boerhaave, has lately been revived with all the confidence of a
<em>new</em> invention. There are cases of narcotic poisoning in which there can
be no doubt it would furnish the practitioner with a valuable resource, but
I much fear that it will be found to be less successful than its more sanguine
advocates have anticipated; for where the stomach has so far lost
its power as to be insensible to the stimulus of a potent emetic, the chances
of recovery are small; the practice, however, in such cases ought never
to be neglected, for it cannot possibly do harm, and may perhaps be beneficial.</p>

<p class='c007'>After all has been ejected, which the operations of art can effect, we
are to proceed, without delay, to the fulfilment of the second indication;
viz.</p>

<h5 class='c044'>2. <em>The Decomposition of any remaining Portion, and the adoption of measures best calculated to obviate its absorption.</em></h5>

<p class='c018'>Where the substance is in a solid form, and acts by absorption, we
should be very cautious how we favour its solution; while, if it exists in
a liquid state, our object must be to render its active portion insoluble;
this problem involves a series of questions which are wholly <em>chemical</em>. In
order to prevent, or retard, the absorption of the active matter, we must, to
a great degree, depend upon the agency of <em>vital</em> adjuvants; this latter indication
however does not apply to <em>Corrosive Sublimate</em> and other substances
which act upon the stomach locally, and are not absorbed; copious
dilution also, in such cases, will frequently disarm the poison of its virulence,<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c015'><sup>[226]</sup></a>
but it should be followed as quickly as possible by vomiting. In
cases where the poison requires to be absorbed, before it can display its
energies, it would be generally unsafe to administer any solvent. Nothing
therefore can be less true as an aphorism, nor more dangerous as a precept,
than the unqualified assertion of Boerhaave, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua omnia venena
enervat, quæ cum aqua misceri possunt</span></i>.” (Prælect. in Instit: T. vi. p. 289.)
<em>Alkaline</em> solutions and <em>Magnesia</em>, in cases of the ingestion of arsenic, accelerate
its fatal effects, by promoting its solution,<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c015'><sup>[227]</sup></a> whereas <em>Lime</em>, or its
<em>Carbonate</em>, has as an opposite tendency,<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c015'><sup>[228]</sup></a> in consequence of the insolubility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>of <em>Arsenite of Lime</em>; so again, Orfila has shewn that the pernicious
qualities of the <em>Muriate of Baryta</em> are counteracted by the administration
of any soluble <em>Sulphate</em>, which renders the former substance <em>insoluble</em>. In
cases where <em>Verdegris</em> has been swallowed, the administration of vinegar
greatly increases its virulence, as M. Drouard has ascertained, by converting
the substance into a soluble <em>acetate of copper</em>. This view of the subject
will explain why the pure earth <em>Baryta</em> is so slow, and comparatively
inert, in its effects upon the system, while its <em>muriate</em> is distinguished by
the extreme rapidity and virulence with which it operates. The propriety
of administering <em>vinegar</em>, <em>lemonade</em>, and different acid potations, in order to
counteract the baneful effects of <em>Opium</em>, which has been so often questioned,
will thus also receive ample explanation; it must appear that, if any
quantity of the substance of opium remain in the primæ viæ, acid, or mucilaginous
drinks will, by favouring its solution and absorption, accelerate
its fatal effects;<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c015'><sup>[229]</sup></a> but should it have been previously ejected from the stomach,
that then the anti-narcotic influence of a vegetable acid<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c015'><sup>[230]</sup></a> may remove
the consecutive stupor and delirium, and thus realize the expectations
which Virgil has so poetically raised.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chardin, in his travels through Persia, informs us that when a Persian
finds himself in a distressed situation, he has recourse to a piece of opium
as large as the thumb, and that immediately afterwards he drinks a glassful
of vinegar; by which he is thrown into a fit of laughter, terminating
in convulsions and death.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the use of <em>Antidotes</em>, it has been already stated how little
they are to be depended upon; in certain cases, however, we are bound
to acknowledge their power, but they should be very rarely trusted, unless
subsequent to, or in conjunction with, the operation of an emetic; in many
cases the effects of this latter remedy may be promoted by the ingestion
of liquids holding the particular antidote in solution, a practice which offers
the double advantage of accelerating the elimination of the poison, and at
the same time of decomposing any which may remain. Orfila has fully
established the fact of <em>Albumen</em> being a counter-poison to <em>Corrosive Sublimate</em>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>vomiting may therefore be very judiciously promoted in cases of
such poisoning by water holding the white of egg in solution; with equal
effect, where <em>Verdegris</em> has been swallowed, sugared water may be used
as a diluent to encourage emesis; and <em>Muriate of Soda</em> in solution will be
found the most efficient antidote to <em>Nitrate of Silver</em>; and <em>Sulphate of
Magnesia</em> to <em>Acetate of Lead</em>. Where an emetic salt, like <em>Tartarized Antimony</em>,
has been taken, copious dilution with common water will in general
so provoke vomiting, as to render it its own antidote; but it may be
useful to remember, that the <em>Infusion of Galls</em>, and according to Berthollet,
the <em>Decoctions of Bark</em>, at the temperature of from 30° to 40° <em>Fah.</em> have
the power of decomposing it; while Orfila considers milk the most efficient
counter-poison to the <em>Sulphate of Zinc</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having ejected from the stomach all the poisonous matter we can by
vomiting, and attempted to decompose what remains, we are to pursue
such measures as may be calculated to prevent the absorption of the
poison into the circulation; it has been already observed that on this
account nauseating emetics should be avoided; the reader is now
requested to refer to our <em>exposé</em> of the celebrated doctrine of <em>Majendie</em>,
(<em>page 86</em>, <em>note</em>) and he will see that <em>Venesection</em> proves one of the most
powerful means of exciting the function of absorption; hence in poisoning
by arsenic, such an expedient should never be recommended,<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c015'><sup>[231]</sup></a> while a particle
of that substance remains in the body; where <em>Corrosive Sublimate</em>
has been swallowed, the same precaution is unnecessary. The last indication
which remains to be fulfilled is—</p>

<h5 class='c044'>3. <em>To anticipate the occurrence of the Consecutive Phœnomena, and to combat them by appropriate treatment.</em></h5>

<p class='c018'>This is to be conducted on the general principles of Therapeutics; the
treatment must necessarily vary in each particular case. Where the exhaustion
of nervous energy is to be feared, as after poisoning by <em>Prussic
Acid</em>, ammonia, and other diffusible stimulants, together with external
warmth, will furnish the best resource; for the same reason Venesection
should be performed with great caution and judgment after a narcotic poison.
Where, on the other hand, inflammatory action is to be anticipated,
it is unnecessary to detail the plan of treatment which may be adopted
with the greatest chance of success. In cases where the nervous system
is stupified, the symptoms may be combated by vegetable acids, infusion

must be had to opiates.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>ESCHAROTICS:<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c015'><sup>[232]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c018'>Substances whose application to the animal solids, erodes, or decomposes
them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>The operation of these bodies may, in general, be considered chemical;
for having destroyed the life of the part to which they are applied, they
cause, as if by a species of resulting affinity, the elements of the animal
matter to enter into a new state of combination; this is well exemplified
in the action of caustic potass, where the nascent elements thus disengaged
by the decomposition of the animal substance, reunite in proportions to
generate an oily matter, which may be observed to form a film over the ulcerated
surface, while the excess of nitrogen and hydrogen constitute ammonia,
which is disengaged during the action of the caustic; and may be
rendered sensible by inverting over the surface, a small jar moistened with
muriatic acid, when the fumes of <em>Muriate of Ammonia</em> become visible.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c015'><sup>[233]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Their surgical value consists in their power to remove excrescencies,
to establish an ulcer, or to convert an ulcerated surface into a simple sore.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>IV. OF MECHANICAL REMEDIES.</h3>

<p class='c018'>This subdivision includes those classes of remedies, whose operation
depends entirely upon <em>mechanical</em> principles; and we must agree with
Dr. Murray in considering them as the least important of all the articles
which we have enumerated, and which cannot therefore constitute objects
of elaborate inquiry.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>ANTHELMINTICS:</h4>

<p class='c018'>Remedies which expel worms<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c015'><sup>[234]</sup></a> from the intestinal canal.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been already stated, (<em>page 90</em>) that certain bodies have the
power of increasing the peristaltic motions of the intestinal canal, by operating
as mechanical stimulants upon its fibres; in this manner the filings
of tin and iron, or the irritating down which covers the pods of the <em>Dolichos
Pruriens</em>, are supposed to act in dislodging and evacuating the
worms from the intestines. But there is a variety of remedies employed
as vermifuges, which must owe their effects to a very different mode of
operation; <em>Bitters</em> for instance appear to prove an absolute poison<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c015'><sup>[235]</sup></a> to
these animals, while they, at the same time, give an increased tone to the
organs of digestion; from whose debility the generation of worms would
seem to arise. Other remedies, again, obviously depend upon their simple
cathartic property, for the powers which they possess in the evacuation of
worms. See <em>Terebinthinæ Oleum</em>—<em>Cambogia</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>In the cure of Ascarides the local application of the remedy becomes
necessary, in the form of glyster, and which acts both <em>mechanically</em> in
washing out the gut, and <em>medicinally</em> in proving obnoxious to the animals.
According to the experience of some of our best practitioners, a strong
decoction of the <em>Semina Santonici</em> proves most efficacious upon these occasions.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>DEMULCENTS:</h4>

<p class='c018'>Medicines which are capable of shielding sensible surfaces from the action
of acrid matter, by involving it in a mild and viscid medium.</p>

<p class='c007'>It cannot be denied that where these remedies admit of direct application,
considerable benefit may arise; in the progress of a catarrh, we have
all experienced the relief that may be occasioned by lubricating the fauces
with demulcents, which, by soothing the top of the trachea, quiets, by a
kind of contiguous sympathy, the whole pulmonary structure; in certain
states of intestinal irritation, the same remedies have furnished considerable
benefit, and in ophthalmia, relief has been obtained by the application
of a demulcent to the inflamed conjunctiva, by which it is defended from
the irritation of the tears; see also <em>Formula 61</em>; but in parts beyond the
reach of the first passages, and to which no fluid can arrive but through
the medium of the secretions, it is very difficult to explain the principle
upon which their beneficial operation can depend; and it seems indeed
highly probable that they act in such cases as simple diluents, for the process
of digestion must necessarily deprive them of their characteristic viscidity.
The administration of demulcent drinks in gonorrhæa is probably
of no farther service in assuaging the <em>ardor urinæ</em>, than an equivalent
quantity of pure water; although Dr. Murray observes, “it is sufficiently
certain, that many substances, which undergo the process of digestion, are
afterwards separated in their entire state from the blood, by particular secreting
organs; and there is, continues he, no gland which has this power
more particularly than the kidneys; substances received into the stomach
and digested, afterwards passing off in the urine with all their peculiar
properties.” This is undoubtedly very true, but mucilaginous substances
rarely or never pass off in this manner; if they evade the assimilative
functions, they pass through the alimentary canal, and are thus eliminated.
I can state, as the result of experiment, that the urine undergoes no change
except in the relative proportion of its water, by the copious and repeated
administration of mild mucilages. Dr. Saunders has very justly remarked
that the long list of <em>Ptisans</em>, <em>Decoctions</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em> usually prescribed upon
these occasions, generally owe their virtues to the watery diluent itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pharmaceutical applications of this class of medicines constitute,
perhaps, not the least part of their value, by which we are enabled to introduce
acrid substances into the stomach with safety and effect; but
such services will more properly fall under our notice in a future part of
the work.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>DILUENTS:</h4>

<p class='c018'>Watery liquors, which increase the fluidity of the blood, and render
several of the secreted and excreted fluids less viscid.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are certainly few remedies whose operation is more simple, obvious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>or important; and yet there are scarcely any whose value has been
more mistaken, or whose application has been so frequently perverted
through the suggestions of false theory; water is the universal beverage
of animals, and the necessity of its supply is indicated by thirst, a sensation
which in excess, is borne with less tranquillity even than that of hunger;
in certain morbid states of the body its presence is to be regarded as
indicating the necessity of copious potation; and yet how often has the
prejudiced physician, under such circumstances, aggravated the pressure
of disease, by adding the sufferings of Tantalus. In febrile affections,
the irritation of thirst tends to keep up the disease, and hence diluents,
besides the other beneficial effects which they may produce, must be regarded
as important remedies. There are also diseases of the alimentary
canal which may be removed by the same agents; when water is conveyed
into the intestines it will have a tendency, by mixing with, and diluting
the biliary secretion, to diminish its acrimony, and thus to obviate a
source of morbid irritation; the dilution of the chyme and chyle may
also have a salutary tendency, and favour the absorption of the finer and
more nutritive parts of the lacteals; and by increasing the fluidity of the
mass, expedite the numerous combinations which it is destined to undergo.
The blood itself is also thus modified in its fluidity; although it has been
very truly observed that in healthy bodies, or such as are without any obstruction
of the excretions, an unusual distension of the vessels cannot be
produced, or at least long subsist; for it is evident that such an increased
quantity of water in the blood will immediately pass off by one or other
of the excretions; this effect, however, in itself, renders the operation of
diluents of signal service in the treatment of the disease; in consequence,
for instance, of their disposition to pass off by urine, they furnish valuable
resources in diseases of the urinary organs, allaying the pain of strangury,
and the irritation from an inflamed bladder. From these observations, the
practitioner will be led to appreciate the value of diluents; and many of
the beneficial effects which are daily experienced from the copious potation
of mineral waters, are, without doubt, to be wholly attributed to simple
dilution. See <em>Aqua</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is here necessary to say a few words upon the misapplication of this
order of remedies. Dr. Davy found by experiment that when an animal
is bled to death, the last portions of blood that flow are of a much lower
specific gravity than that which flows first, in consequence of the former
containing more water, which it may be inferred was derived by the increased
activity of the absorbents, exerted chiefly on mucous and serous
membranes. Since then venesection promotes and accelerates absorption,<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c015'><sup>[236]</sup></a>
it is clear that, in inflammatory diseases, where we have recourse to
blood-letting, in order to diminish the volume of circulating fluids, we ought
not to suffer the patient to indulge in an unrestrained use of liquids, which
he eagerly demands to satisfy a thirst which, in all probability, is the natural
consequence of increased absorption. In such cases, it is often better
to take liquids in small divided doses, which will have the effect of moderating
the thirst, without overloading the arterial system, and bringing
on that tension and plenitude which are liable to be produced by swallowing
too large a proportion of liquids.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the use of water upon such occasions, it may moreover be observed,
that its temperature ought to be attended to; as a general rule it may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>laid down, that in the <em>cold</em> stage it should be hot, in the <em>hot</em>, cold, and in
the <em>sweating</em>, tepid.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the value of diluents, as capable of promoting the operation
of other remedies, many observations of great practical importance
might be adduced; but this subject will be more properly elucidated when
we come to consider the influence of solubility in modifying the activity of
medicinal substances, and which constitutes a very curious and interesting
object of chemico-medical enquiry.</p>

<p class='c007'>While speaking of Diluents it may be cursorily noticed, that water appears,
under certain circumstances of the body, to suffer decomposition,
and to have its elements appropriated to new combinations. Count Rumford
has endeavoured to prove, that the surprisingly small quantity of solid
food which is sufficient for nourishment, when converted into rich and
palatable soup, is owing to the culinary process having prepared the water
for chemical decomposition,<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c015'><sup>[237]</sup></a> and that this is ultimately effected during
the act of Digestion.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c015'><sup>[238]</sup></a> It cannot be denied that the exorbitant potation of
water has a tendency to produce fat, but this may depend upon the vascular
distention which is thus occasioned. Gin drinkers, before they become
materially injured by the habit, grow extremely corpulent, as may often
be witnessed in unfortunate cyprians of the lower orders. Can the hydrogen
of the spirit contribute to this effect?</p>

<h4 class='c034'>EMOLLIENTS:</h4>

<p class='c018'>Substances whose application diminishes the force of cohesion in the
particles of the solid matter of the human body, and thereby renders them
more lax and flexible.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to this definition, which we derive from Dr. Cullen, the primary
operation of emollients would appear to be purely mechanical, for
they are insinuated into the matter of the solid fibre, and either diminish
its density, or lessen the friction between its particles; this explanation will
undoubtedly apply to those emollients which consist of unctuous bodies,
and which are introduced into the animal fibre by friction; but it is evident
that the beneficial effects of <em>Cataplasms</em> and <em>Fomentations</em> cannot be
so explained; for in these instances, none of the materials can be absorbed
through the entire cuticle; and yet the relaxation and consequent ease
which such warm applications produce on inflamed surfaces is very considerable,
but it must be wholly attributed to the relaxing effects of warmth
and moisture upon the extreme vessels of the surface, propagated by <em>contiguous
sympathy</em> to the deeper seated organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The operation of those substances which afford relief to excoriated surfaces
by their bland qualities, as mucilaginous lotions in erysipelatous affections,
is too obvious to require explanation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having thus investigated the manner in which medicinal substances
produce their effects upon the living system, we shall be better prepared
to appreciate the advantages which are to be derived from their combination
with each other, and to escape the too common error of uniting in
one formula, remedies which are rendered adverse by the incompatibility
of their physiological actions.</p>

<p class='c051'>“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Variorum mixtura novas sæpe vires generet, in simplicibus nequaquam reperiundas

<div class='c039'><span class='sc'>Gaubius.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>It is a truth universally admitted, that the arm of physic has derived
much additional power and increased energy, from the resources which
are furnished by the mixture and combination of medicinal bodies. I by
no means intend to insinuate that the physician cannot frequently fulfil his
most important indications by the administration of one simple remedy; I
only contend that, in many cases, by its scientific combination with other
medicines, it will not only act with greater certainty and less inconvenience,
but that its sphere of influence may be thus more widely extended,
and its powers so modified or changed, as to give rise to a remedy of new
powers. Such a theory is amply justified by the state of combination in
which certain medicinal principles are found in our more efficient vegetable
remedies, while the medicinal practice founded upon it is thus, as it
were, sanctioned by Nature’s own prescriptions; enter but her laboratory,
and you will soon be satisfied, that many of her potent remedies do not
owe their valuable powers to any one specific ingredient, but to the combined
or modified energies of various, and sometimes opposite principles.
This view of the subject opens an interesting and unexplored field<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c015'><sup>[239]</sup></a> of medical
and chemical research, and I shall endeavour to avail myself of the
novelties its investigation may present, and of the hints it may suggest
for the improvement of <em>extemporaneous combination</em>. By contemplating the
laws by which Nature effects her wise purposes, we may learn to emulate
her processes, and even in some cases to correct and assist her operations:<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c015'><sup>[240]</sup></a>
such at least has been the happy result of our labours in the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>departments of natural knowledge. It is said for instance that by observing
the means used by nature for preventing the diffusion of light in the
eye-ball, Euler derived an important hint for the improvement of his telescope;
and more lately, the structure of the crystalline humour of the eye
has been successfully imitated in the invention of achromatic lenses. On
the other hand, it is hardly necessary to observe to what extent these instruments
of art are capable of improving and multiplying the powers of
that natural organ, to the contemplation of whose structure and functions,
we are, as I have just stated, so greatly indebted for their origin and perfection.
So shall I endeavour to shew, in the progress of this work, that
the combinations of nature, as exemplified in her more valuable remedies,
are capable, if properly studied, of suggesting many important hints for
improving the arrangements of art; while art in return may frequently
supply the defects, or extend the advantages of natural compounds.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>AN ANALYSIS<br /> <span class='small'>OF</span><br /> <span class='c052'>THE OBJECTS TO BE OBTAINED BY MIXING AND COMBINING MEDICINAL SUBSTANCES.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The objects to be attained, and the resources which are furnished, by
<span class='sc'>Medicinal Combination</span>, together with the different modes of its operation,
and the laws by which it is governed, may with much practical
advantage be arranged in the following order.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>I.<br /> TO PROMOTE THE ACTION OF THE BASIS, OR PRINCIPAL MEDICINE.</h4>

<h5 class='c044'>A.—<em>By combining together several different Forms, or Preparations, of the same substance</em>.</h5>

<p class='c018'>The utility of such a combination is obvious, whenever we desire the
full and general effects of <em>all</em> the principles of a medicinal body in solution;
thus, where the <em>Bark</em> is required in the cure of an intermittent fever,
and the stomach will not allow the exhibition of the powder, it will
be eligible to conjoin in one formula, the tincture, decoction, and extract,
as exemplified by <em>Formulæ 42, 126, 127</em>. The necessity of such a combination
may be expressed by the following canon. <em>Whenever the chemical
nature of the medicinal substance will not admit of the full solution of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>its active principles in any</em> <span class='sc'>One</span> <em>Solvent</em>, <em>and its exhibition in substance is at
the same time impracticable</em>. For farther illustrations see <em>Form. 2, 25, 33,
38, 70, 109</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Practitoners, probably without having reasoned upon the theory, have
very generally adopted the practice, of combining the different solutions of
the same substance; for in the prescriptions of practical physicians we
commonly find, that the decoction or infusion of a vegetable remedy is
quickened by a certain portion of a corresponding tincture.</p>

<h5 class='c044'>B.—<em>By combining the Basis with Substances which are of the</em> <span class='fss'>SAME NATURE</span>, <em>that is, which are</em> <span class='fss'>INDIVIDUALLY</span> <em>capable of producing the same effect, but with less energy than when in combination with each other.</em></h5>

<p class='c018'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Fordyce</span> first established the existence of the singular and important
law, that <em>a combination of similar<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c015'><sup>[241]</sup></a> remedies will produce a more certain,
speedy, and considerable effect than an equivalent dose of any single one</em>; a
fact which does not appear to have been known to any ancient physician.
The earliest mention of it that I can find is by <span class='sc'>Valisnieri</span>, the favourite
pupil of Malpighi, who filled the medical chair at Padua in 1711, nearly
ninety years before Fordyce published his valuable memoir on the combination
of medicines, but he does not attempt any generalization<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c015'><sup>[242]</sup></a> of
the subject; he merely states, as the result of careful experiments, that
twelve drachms of <em>Cassia Pulp</em> are about equivalent in purgative strength
to four ounces of <em>Manna</em>; and yet, says he, if we give eight drachms of
<em>Cassia Pulp</em>, in combination with four drachms of <em>Manna</em>, we obtain double
the effect! How, adds the professor, can this possibly happen?
Surely the very contrary <em>ought</em> to obtain, since four drachms of <em>Cassia</em>
are much more than equivalent to an equal weight of <em>Manna</em>; the
strength of the former being to that of the latter as 8 to 3.</p>

<p class='c007'>The truth of this law of medicinal combination must be continually felt
by the practitioner in the ordinary routine of his practice, viz.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Narcotics</span> will better fulfil the intention of allaying irritation and pain,
when composed of several of such medicines in combination, than when
they consist of any single one, even should the dose, in this latter case, be
increased. See <em>Formulæ 3, 4, 5</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Antispasmodics</span> acquire increased efficacy by the application of the
same principle. <em>Form. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bitter Tonics</span> are also thus exalted, see <em>Form. 39, 40, 41</em>. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>beneficial effects, however, which arise from combinations of this kind will
admit of a satisfactory explanation upon another principle; we may, for
instance, consider them as medicines, differing from each other in their
composition, and producing by their union an assemblage of bitter, astringent,
and aromatic principles.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Aromatic</span> and <span class='sc'>Diffusible Stimulants</span>. There are perhaps no remedies
which receive greater mutual benefit be intermixture with each
other, than the individuals which compose this class; for they not only
thus acquire increased force and efficacy, but at the same time they lose
much of their acrimony; if, for instance, any one spice, as the dried capsule
of the <em>Capsicum</em>, be taken into the stomach, it will excite a sense of
heat and pain; in like manner will a quantity of <em>Black Pepper</em>; but if an
equivalent quantity of these two stimulants be given in combination with
each other, no such sense of pain is produced, but, on the contrary, a
pleasant warmth is experienced, and a genial glow felt over the whole
body; and if a greater number of spices be joined together, the chance of
pain and inflammation being produced is still farther diminished. The
truth of this law is also strikingly illustrated, as Dr. Fordyce has observed,
by that universal maxim in cookery, <em>never to employ one spice, if more can be
procured</em>; the object, in this case, being to make the stomach bear a large
quantity of food without nausea.<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c015'><sup>[243]</sup></a> This same principle also finds an illustration
of its importance, as it regards the class of stimulants, in the following
preparations of our Pharmacopœia, viz. “<em>Pulvis Cinnamomi Compositus</em>;
<em>Infusum Armoraciæ compositum</em>; <em>Infusum Aurantii Compositum</em>;
<em>Spiritus Lavendulæ compositus</em>; <em>Tinctura Cinchonæ composita</em>; <em>Tinctura
Valeriana Ammoniata</em>; and the <em>Confectio Opii</em>, the elegant and scientific
substitute for the celebrated <em>Mithridate</em> or <em>Theriaca</em>. The practitioner is
also referred to <em>Form. 45, 47</em>, and to <em>Allii Radix</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The local action of these stimulants would appear to be placed under
the dominion of the same law, and perhaps the origin of the custom, so
long observed, of mixing together the varieties of snuff, may thus receive
a plausible and philosophical explanation; certain it is that by such combination
the harsh pungency of each ingredient will be diminished, whilst
the general potency of the application, in exciting the nerves, will be increased,
and rendered more grateful; the same principle will direct the
formation of safe and efficient plaisters and lotions; the <em>Emplastrum Cumini</em>
of the London, and the <em>Emplastrum Aromaticum</em> of the Dublin Pharmacopœia,
offer examples of its judicious application.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Astringents.</span> For illustrations see <em>Form. 51, 58</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Emetics</span> are certainly more efficient when composed of <em>Ipecacuan</em> united
with <em>Tartarized Antimony</em>, or <em>Sulphate of Zinc</em>, than when they simply
consist of any one of such substances in an equivalent dose. See <em>Form.
63, 65</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cathartics</span> not only acquire a very great increase of power by combination
with each other, but they are at the same time rendered less irritating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>in their operation; the <em>Extractum Colocynthidis compositum</em> affords an
excellent example of a compound purgative mass being much more active
and manageable, and less liable to irritate, than any one of its components
separately taken. Additional examples of this fact are furnished by <em>Formulæ
70, 76, 78, 79, 81, 88</em>. In many cases, however, the fact of purgatives
thus accelerating and correcting each other’s operation may be explained
by considering them as substances endowed with different powers,
as already demonstrated, (p. 88), and which will be more fully considered
in the third division of this Essay.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Diuretics.</span> Under this class of medicinal agents it may be observed
that, <em>whenever a medicine is liable to produce effects different from those we desire,
its combination with similar remedies is particularly eligible</em>, by which
the action of the basis may be directed and fixed; thus the individuals
which compose the class of Diuretics are uncertain in their operation, and
disposed when exhibited singly to produce diaphoretic, and other contrary
effects; it is, therefore, in such cases, highly judicious to unite several of
them in one Formula, by which we increase their powers, and are more
likely to ensure their operation. <em>Formulæ 101, 103, 108, 109, 110, 111,
115</em>, are constructed upon this principle.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Diaphoretics.</span> Our maxim, “<span class='sc'>Vis Unita Fortior</span>,” certainly applies
with equal truth to this class of medicinal agents. <em>Form. 122, 124</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Expectorants.</span> More is frequently to be gained by the co-operation
of these remedies than can be obtained by the exhibition of them separately,
as in <em>Form. 134, 135</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Demulcents</span> do not appear to obtain any other benefit from combination
than, occasionally, a convenience and efficacy of application arising
from a suitable degree of consistence and solubility. See article “<em>Trochisci</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The operation of the law which has thus formed the first object of this
inquiry, will be found, like every other, to have a natural and well defined
limit; it is easy to perceive that by multiplying the number of ingredients
too far, we shall either so increase the quantity and bulk of the medicine
as to render it nauseous and cumbersome, or so reduce the dose of each
constituent as to fritter away the force and energy of the combination.</p>

<p class='c007'>The propriety of combining <em>several</em> stimulants, of the diffusible class, in
<em>one</em> formula, has been questioned on different grounds. Dr. Chapman, in
his work on Therapeutics, adduces some arguments on this point, which,
although they fail in establishing his general position, certainly suggest
an important exception to the practice in question; “by directing,” says
he, “stimulating remedies, <em>separately</em>, we shall economise our resources in
many lingering diseases.” The justness of this statement must be admitted
to its fullest extent, and practitioners will, on certain occasions, do well
to act in conformity with the views that suggested it; for instance, in the
feeble forms of protracted fevers, where the indications are to be met with
the continued action of stimulants, it will certainly be salutary to alternate
the use of <em>camphor</em>, <em>ammonia</em>, and other remedies of a similar nature, in
preference to presenting them all at once in combination, so that the system
may not lose its susceptibility by the continued impression of the same
stimulant; the same motive should induce us, on particular occasions, to
employ in succession different narcotics, for each of them affects sensibility
in its own peculiar manner.<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c015'><sup>[244]</sup></a> The nervous system, as <em>Richerand</em> has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>very justly observed, may be compared to a soil, rich in different juices,
and which requires the cultivator to plant the germs of a diversified vegetation
to develope the whole of its fecundity; to insure a perpetual return,
therefore, it will be right to sow a succession of different seeds. Hoffman
also has offered us some advice upon this subject; he directs us in the
treatment of chronic diseases to suspend the administration of remedies, at
intervals, and afterwards to resume them, lest the system should become
<em>habituated</em>, and ultimately <em>insensible</em> to their influence.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there remains for our investigation a still more important precaution
respecting this law of medicinal combination;—that, in combining substances
in the manner, and for the object just related, the practitioner
should be well satisfied that their medicinal virtues are in reality <em>practically</em>
<span class='sc'>Similar</span>, or he will fall into an error of the most fatal tendency; it has
been already shewn, and I hope I shall not be considered tedious by again
directing the reader’s attention to the fact, that medicines are not necessarily
similar because they have been arranged in the same artificial division
of remedies; in order to establish a perfect similarity <em>their operations must
be found by experience to continue similar under every condition of the human
body; and that, moreover, they must owe such similarity to modes of operation
which are compatible with each other, and consonant with the general mode of
cure</em>; we have only to refer to the history of Diuretics (<em>page 92</em>) for a
full illustration of this important truth; thus <em>Squill</em>, <em>Calomel</em>, and <em>Digitalis</em>,
are each powerful Diuretics, but nevertheless they cannot be considered
<em>similar</em> remedies, since <em>Digitalis</em> will entirely fail in its effects in the very
cases that <em>Calomel and Squill</em> succeed; and <em>Squill</em> will prove inert when
<em>Digitalis</em> is capable of producing the most powerful influence; this arises
from their modes of operation being dissimilar, and consequently requiring
for their success such different states of the living system. <em>Squill</em>, it will
be seen, acts <em>primarily</em> on the urinary organs, by stimulating the secreting
vessels of the kidneys; <em>Mercury</em>, on the contrary, acts primarily on the
absorbents, and <em>secondarily</em> on the kidneys; whereas <em>Digitalis</em> produces its
effects by diminishing arterial action, and increasing that of absorption.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Blackall, in his “Observations upon the Cure of Dropsies,” has offered
some remarks so valuable in themselves, and so illustrative of this
important subject, that I shall take leave to quote the passage. “Many
physicians,” he observes, “are fond of combining <em>Squill</em>, <em>Calomel</em>, and
<em>Digitalis</em>, as a diuretic in dropsy; a practice unsafe, and not very decidedly
possessing the merit even of being consistent. <em>Digitalis</em> greatly depresses
the action of the heart and arteries, and controls the circulation,
and it seems most unreasonable to believe that its curative powers can be
independent of such an effect; on the other hand, <em>Mercury</em>, if it does not
pass off quickly, is always exciting fever, and raising and hardening the
pulse; speaking from experience, where the urine is coaguable, and <em>Digitalis</em>
agrees, both the others are, often at least, positively injurious. On
the contrary, where the urine is foul, and not coaguable, and <em>Squills</em> with
<em>Calomel</em> render service, I have on that very account, made less trial of Digitalis,
and cannot therefore speak of it from much experience.” See
<em>Form. 103</em>, and the <em>note</em> thereon.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>The individual medicines which compose the class of <span class='sc'>Diaphoretics</span>
vary no less in their primary operations, as the synoptical arrangement at
<em>page 99</em> very fully exemplifies; thus, in the cure of intermittent fevers,
diaphoretics are useful both in the paroxysm, and during the intermission;
in the first case they shorten its duration; in the second they support the
tone of the extreme vessels, and prevent its recurrence; but in these opposite
states of disease a very different kind of diaphoretic is required—to
fulfil the first indication, a cooling and relaxing one is necessary; to answer
the second, the stimulating diaphoretic is exacted; the one may be
said to <em>solicit</em>, the other to <em>extort</em>, perspiration. So again <span class='sc'>Emmenagogues</span>
can only be considered relative agents, since the suppression of the catamenia
may depend upon, or be connected with, very different states of the
system; in some cases with a diminished, and in others with an increased
state of excitement; for on many occasions the suppression of the menses
is the effect, and not the cause of disease; <em>Boerhaave</em> has very justly observed,
that it is a most dangerous error to ascribe all the diseases of young
females to a retention of the catamenia, which often do not appear because
the patients are disordered from other causes. If, therefore, we were to
attempt a combination of the several medicines which have gained reputation
as <em>Emmenagogues</em>, it is very obvious, that we should bring together
an assemblage of adverse and incompatible remedies; nor would the physician
be less inconsistent were he to combine <span class='sc'>Expectorants</span>, without a
due regard to their modes of operation; it is only necessary to observe
their classification, as presented at page 102, to become satisfied how greatly
the success of such remedies must depend upon their scientific adaptation
to each particular case.</p>

<p class='c007'>The class of <span class='sc'>Antispasmodics</span> may likewise embrace remedies of the
most opposite tendency, for spasm may occur under the most opposite circumstances—in
an extreme condition of weakness, as in nervous affections,
and in an highly excited state, as in cholic, &amp;c.; it is hardly necessary,
therefore, to point out the mischief that must arise from the fortuitous
and indiscriminate admixture of the individual substances which are thus
unavoidably arranged in the same artificial classification. <em>Bark</em> and <em>Steel</em>
are also too often considered as equivalent <em>Tonics</em>; in Dropsy, says Dr.
Blackall, it is far otherwise, the former being infinitely to be preferred after
the dropsy of young persons, of acute disease, and of sound stamina;
the latter being suited to a vitiated rather than to a feeble habit, and indicated
more by a pale sallow complexion, and a want of red colour in the
blood, as shewn by the paleness of the lips, than by any other signs.
Need we then adduce farther illustrations of the obvious but important
fact, that the terms employed to denote the different classes of remedies
are frequently but relative ones, expressive of effects which are produced
only in reference to a particular state of the living body? and as this necessarily
varies in different states of health and disease, it follows that medicines
are convertible agents, and that when we attempt to institute general
rules respecting their administration, without taking into consideration
the constitution and circumstances of the patient upon whom they
are to operate, we shall generally be disappointed in the result. We may
say of medicines what Van Swieten said of diet, “to assert that such, or
such a thing be wholesome, without a knowledge of the condition of the
person for whom it is intended, is like a sailor pronouncing the wind to be
fair without knowing to what port the vessel is bound.” Boerhaave was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>so fully impressed with this truth that he exclaimed, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nullum ego cognosco
remedium, nisi quod tempestivo usu fiat tale</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Although medicines which produce the same ultimate effects by modes
of operation obviously different, cannot be considered <span class='fss'>SIMILAR</span>, in the sense
affixed to the term in the present section, yet if these different modes of
operation be not physiologically incompatible with each other, the union
of such remedies may not only be admissible, but even useful; and it will,
accordingly, constitute an object of inquiry in a succeeding section.
(III. A.)</p>

<h5 class='c044'>C.—<em>By combining the Basis with Substances of a</em> <span class='fss'>DIFFERENT NATURE</span>, <em>and which do not exert any Chemical influence upon it, but are found, by experience, to be capable of rendering the Stomach, or System, or any particular organ, more susceptible of its action</em>.</h5>

<p class='c018'>Thus it is that the system is rendered more susceptible of the influence
of Mercury, by combining it with Antimony and Opium.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c015'><sup>[245]</sup></a> Where the
stomach is insensible to impressions, the exhibition of Opium previous to,
or in combination with, any active medicine, often assists its operation;
this is remarkably striking in some states of mania, when emetics will
fail, unless the stomach be previously influenced and prepared by a narcotic;
indeed, in ordinary cases of inirritability of stomach, the addition
of a small quantity of opium will often render an emetic active.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c015'><sup>[246]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>So again the system, when it is in that particular condition which is
indicated by a hot and dry skin, is unsusceptible of the expectorant powers
of Squill, unless it be in union with antimony or some powerful diaphoretic,
(<em>Form. 134</em>.) Squill is by no means disposed to act upon the urinary
organs, when exhibited singly; but calomel, and some other mercurial
preparations,<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c015'><sup>[247]</sup></a> when in conjunction with it, appear to direct its influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>to the kidneys, and to render these organs more susceptible of its operation;
(103, 106.) Upon the same principle, <em>Antimonial Wine</em> quickens
the operation of saline cathartics (69); <em>Opium</em> increases the sudorific
powers of <em>Antimony</em> (124); and the purgative operation of <em>Jalap</em> is promoted
by <em>Ipecacuan</em> (84). Dr. Aikin asserts that fifteen grains of the former
purgative when combined with two or three grains of the latter root,
will purge more than double that quantity of Jalap when administered
without such an adjunct.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir John Pringle speaks of the advantages which may be obtained by
combining an alkali with a bitter infusion, by which the diuretic effects of
the former will be increased, while the latter is calculated to remove any
gastric debility, and to impart a general tone to the body: there is no doubt
but that <em>Bitters</em>, from their invigorating influence upon the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>,
(<em>see page 78</em>) increase the effects of remedies whose operation is connected
with changes <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in transitu</span></i>, or with absorption, as in the exhibition of certain
diuretics;<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c015'><sup>[248]</sup></a> they also frequently render the stomach and bowels more susceptible
of bodies that act by impression, as purgatives, emetics, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may discover the operation of such a principle in some of the more
active compounds presented to us by nature: many herbs owe their efficacy
to a cause of this kind. <em>Elaterium</em>, as I have ascertained by experiment,
contains a purgative element, <em>sui generis</em>, (<em>Elatin</em>) and a bitter
principle, which in itself is quite inert, and yet its presence in the compound
renders the alimentary canal more susceptible of the impression of
the active ingredient, and therefore increases its force. See <em>Extract</em>. <em>Elaterii.</em>
The history of <em>Senna</em> will afford some interesting facts in farther
elucidation of this subject; the leaves of this plant, like <em>Elaterium</em>, appear
to contain an active principle, in combination with a bitter, which latter
ingredient, although destitute of purgative properties, considerably increases
those of the former; for if this be removed, as happens when
Senna is transplanted into the south of France, the purgative principle is
weakened, but may be again restored by the artificial addition of some
bitter extractive. The fruit or pods of Senna<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c015'><sup>[249]</sup></a> contain only the purgative
principle, and are therefore comparatively feeble, unless the defect be
compensated by art. Dr. Cullen has observed that a much smaller quantity
of the leaves is required for a dose if they be infused in company
with some bitter plant; and it has been found that the watery infusion of
<em>Rhubarb</em> is rendered more purgative by the addition of <em>Calumba</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The experiments of Seguin have established beyond all doubt that the
active principle of vegetable astringents is a peculiar element, to which
the name of <em>Tannin</em> has been given; but the efficacy of this ingredient
is undoubtedly enhanced by the presence of the gallic acid with which it
is usually associated, although this acid, when separated from the native
combination, is incapable of producing the least astringent effect; that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>peculiar flavour which we so commonly experience in unripe fruits, and
which we designate by the term <em>acerbness</em>, is the result of a combination of
the astringent principle with some vegetable acid. The relative sweetness
of sugar, when in different degrees of purity, depends upon the operation
of the same law of combination; <em>pure sugar</em>, as Dr. Mac Culloch
has very justly observed, however paradoxical it may appear, <em>is not so
sweet as that which is impure</em>; the sweetness of <em>melasses</em>, compared with
that of refined sugar, is too well known to require more than a bare mention;
the vegetable extractive matter in this case, increases the effect of
the saccharine principle with which it is combined; for the same reason
grapes, differing very materially in their proportion of saccharine matter,
may seem <em>to the taste</em> equally sweet, and such in fact is the case on comparing
the luscious grapes of Spain, with the <em>Chasselas</em> of Paris; and
yet the vinous produce is entirely different, the result of the one being a
sweet and luscious wine, while that of the other is hard and dry, because,
in truth, these grapes contain very different proportions of sugar; and
however powerfully the extractive matter may modify the effects of this
principle upon the palate and organs of taste, it cannot alter the quantity
of alcohol resulting from its fermentation.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c015'><sup>[250]</sup></a> Crystallized sugar also appears
less sweet to the taste than loaf sugar, but this may depend upon
the different state of aggregation, and, consequently, the different degrees
of solubility possessed by the sugar in these two forms.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some cases, the addition of certain bodies will induce the absorbents
to admit and carry into the circulation remedies which, in a more simple
state, they would reject as injurious; this position is supported by the fact
of mercury being more readily absorbed when in combination with animal
matter, see <em>Ung: Hydrarg:</em> and it is probable that iron, in the form of a
<em>tanno-gallate</em>, will be more acceptable than when presented in a more
purely mineral state: see <em>Ferri Sulphas</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Does it not therefore appear from the preceding remarks, that <em>certain
elements exist in the composition of vegetable remedies, as furnished by nature,
which, although individually inert, confer additional strength and impulse upon
the principle of activity with which they are associated</em>.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c015'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>The solutions of saline cathartics appear likewise to gain an accession
of power and celerity of operation by impregnation with <em>Carbonic acid
gas</em>, depending probably upon the intestines thus receiving a degree of
distention favourable to the action of the salt, (19, 23.) Certain it is that
the operation of emetics, as well as that of glysters, is materially increased
by the stimulus of distention.</p>

<p class='c007'>In enumerating the methods to be adopted for increasing the energies
of a remedy, by rendering the system more susceptible of its action, it is
right to know that, under certain circumstances, Venesection deserves a
distinguished rank amongst the <span class='sc'>Adjuvantia</span>. The fact is strikingly discovered
in the exhibition of <em>Mercurial<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c015'><sup>[252]</sup></a> Preparations</em>, and some other alterative
medicines. Whether the “<em>Vis Conservatrix</em>,” which Nature, when
in a state of health and vigour, opposes to the admission of poisonous substances
into the circulation, be overcome by blood-letting, is a question
which I shall leave others to decide; but thus much reiterated practice
has taught me, that the system in a strong and healthy condition frequently
is overcome the moment the stomach becomes deranged, the circulation
languid, or the general tone of the system impaired. I have frequently
seen this during my Hospital practice: if a patient who has been
using mercurial friction, or taking the preparations of that metal without
effect, be transferred into a close and unhealthy ward, his appetite soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>fails, the tongue becomes furred, and the system instantly yields to the
influence of the remedy. Nauseating doses of <em>antimony</em><a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c015'><sup>[253]</sup></a> frequently repeated,
or the accidental supervention of any disease of debility, will be
attended with the same phenomena. My practice has also afforded me
an opportunity of appreciating the debilitating effects of despondency in a
case of this description; a patient had been taking mercurial medicines,
and using frictions for a considerable period, without any apparent effect:
under these circumstances he was abruptly told that he would fall a victim
to his disease; the unhappy man experienced an unusual shock at
this opinion, and in a few hours became violently salivated.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c015'><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Venesection</span>, moreover, increases the effects of cathartic medicines.
I have often noticed this fact in contending with a plethoric diathesis;
whenever the bleeding preceded the purgative, the effects of the latter
have been uniformly more speedy and considerable; in obstinate constipation
the same fact has been observed, and mild remedies have been known
to act more powerfully, when preceded by blood-letting, than potent ones
have when exhibited antecedent to it. Venesection has certainly an extraordinary
power in awakening the susceptibility of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i> to remedial
impressions; in some diseases, as in the <em>Cynanche Trachealis</em>, or
Croup, so great is the insensibility of the stomach, that Emetics frequently
fail in their effects; and Dr. Hamilton has given as much as a hundred
grains of <em>Calomel</em> in the twenty-four hours: in such cases previous venesection
affords most extraordinary assistance. Dr. Fothergill also remarks
that emetics are more beneficial after bleeding, (<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dissert. Med. Inaug. de
Emet. usu.</span></cite>) The effects of <em>Bark</em>, <em>Steel</em>, and other tonics, are certainly influenced
in the same manner; whether in any case it may be prudent or
judicious to have recourse to such a practice, is a question not immediately
connected with the present inquiry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Limited must have been the experience of that practitioner who has not
frequently witnessed the utility of Venesection in producing a state of system
favourable to the operation of various remedies. In acute diseases,
how frequently does an opiate succeed in allaying irritation after copious
bleeding, which could not be made to occasion any beneficial influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>previous to that operation? In Pneumonia I have repeatedly seen such
a plan of treatment act like a charm upon the patient.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Purgatives</span> also awaken the susceptibility of the body to mercurial
impressions, and it is remarked by Dr. Chapman that this practice affords
a resource which rarely disappoints the practitioner. This class of remedies
moreover seems capable of exalting the efficacy, and indeed of accelerating
the benefit to be derived from many alteratives, when administered
<em>previous</em> to the exhibition of these latter substances; the advantages
of a course of Steel medicines are undoubtedly increased by such
means. The febrifugous and antiseptic properties of diluted muriatic acid
(see <em>Form. 145</em>.) are inconsiderable, unless its exhibition be accompanied
with cathartics. I beg to refer the practitioner to some cases published
by me in the <cite>Medical and Physical Journal for December</cite>, 1809, in further
illustration of these views. Experience enables me also to state that
<em>Diuretics</em> are considerably assisted by similar means, having many instances
in my case book of the failure of these agents before, and their
successful operation after, the exhibition of a cathartic. Dr. Darwin observes
that “<em>Absorptions are always increased by Inanition</em>,” and in support
of this position refers to the frequent advantage derived from evacuations
in the cure of ulcers. I have certainly seen obstinate sores in the leg
cured by small and repeated bleedings. Dr. Chapman arrives at the
same conclusion, although by a different train of reasoning; he states that
the blood-vessels and absorbents<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c015'><sup>[255]</sup></a> are to a certain extent “antagonising
powers:” instructed by this obvious fact, we ought, says he, in the exhibition
of diuretics to regulate the state of the system by interposing purgatives,
or even venesection, as the state of the circulation may indicate.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Emetics</span> also, in certain conditions of the system, would appear to render
the stomach more sensible to the impression of other remedies; Dr.
Eberle, of Philadelphia,<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c015'><sup>[256]</sup></a> has remarked such an effect with respect to
the administration of the Peruvian Bark.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Change of Diet and of Habits</span> may be also classed amongst the
<em>Ajuvantia</em>, but the young practitioner must be warned that he is not to exercise
his <em>Caduceus</em> as Sancho’s Doctor did his wand. I have seen a
young disciple of Esculapius so vex his patient, that his food became
more nauseous to him than his medicine, and I verily believe his Physician
was more irksome than his disease. It was well observed by Dr.
Percival that the prejudices of the sick should never be contemned with
wantonness, or opposed with harshness; for, silenced by authority, they
will operate secretly and forcibly on the mind, creating fear, anxiety, and
watchfulness. And with regard to diet it may be here stated, that no
function of the body is so materially influenced by mental impressions as
that series of actions constituting what is termed <em>Digestion</em>—the unexpected
communication of any distressing event destroys the keenest appetite,<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c015'><sup>[257]</sup></a>
and converts the sensation of hunger into one of disgust at the bare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>idea of food: a fact which did not escape the penetrating eye of our immortal
Shakespeare, for he represents Henry dismissing Wolsey from his
government with these words—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>—— Read o’er this;</div>
      <div class='line'>And after, this: and then to breakfast</div>
      <div class='line'><em>with what appetite</em> you have.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>If feelings of disgust are excited by the repast, the stomach will never
act with healthy energy on the ingesta; and in cases of extreme aversion,
they are either returned, or they pass through the alimentary canal
almost unchanged: on the other hand, the gratification which attends a
favourite meal is in itself a specific stimulus to the organs of digestion,
especially in weak and debilitated habits. Dr. Merriman has lately communicated
to me a case which affords a striking illustration of the powerful
influence of the mind upon these organs: a lady of rank labouring
under menorrhagia, suffered with that irritable and unrelenting state of
stomach which so commonly attends that disease, and to such a degree
that every kind of aliment and medicine was alike rejected: after the total
failure of the usual expedients to appease the stomach and procure relief,
she applied to Miss Prescott, and was <em>magnetised</em>, when she immediately,
to the astonishment of all her friends, ate a beef steak, and continued to
repeat the meal every day for six weeks, without the least inconvenience!
but the disease itself, notwithstanding this treacherous amnesty of the stomach,
continued with unabated violence, and shortly afterwards terminated
her life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The diet of a sick person ought never to <em>combine too much nutriment in
too small a space</em>;<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c015'><sup>[258]</sup></a> when so given it will even in health be followed by
<em>fermentation</em> instead of <em>digestion</em>; and although we may admit the expediency
of that domestic maxim, “<em>a little and often</em>,” yet this is to be received
with limitation; no one, for instance, who possesses any philosophical
knowledge, will adapt his practice to the notions of Sir William
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Temple, who asserted that “the stomach of a valetudinarian was like
a school-boy, always doing mischief when unemployed,” and that we
should therefore not allow it any interval of repose: to this I answer, that
the conversion of aliment into blood is effected by a series of elaborate
processes, several of which are only perfectly performed during the quiescence
of the rest: it would seem, for instance, that the process of <em>chylification</em>
is incompatible with that by which the first changes are produced
in the stomach; this is evident from the well-known fact, that our appetite
for food ceases when the former process commences, although the repast
should, at the time, have been insufficient to satisfy the craving of
nature; whereas, in diseases of imperfect, or depraved digestion, as in
<em>Diabetes</em>, <em>Tabes Mesenterica</em>, &amp;c. we find that the appetite for food is never
satisfied by the most nutritive meals. It merits notice also, that whenever
the stomach be called into action during the assimilating stages of digestion,
the process will, in weak persons, be much disturbed, if not entirely
suspended. These views have long since confirmed me in the propriety
of treating mesenteric affections in a manner very different from that which
is generally pursued; and I may add that the result has been very satisfactory.
The plan to which I allude, consists in enforcing longer intervals
between each meal, which should be scanty, and in quantity short of what
the appetite may require; in this way are the unwilling absorbents induced
to perform their duties with greater promptitude and activity; but
it is a practice which, from the extreme anxiety of friends and relatives,
the feelings of craving and hunger expressed by the patient, and the mistaken
but universal prejudice respecting diet, it is always painful to propose,
and generally impossible to enforce; where, however, circumstances
have given a full and unreserved controul, the advantage of the plan
has been most decisive.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is still another remark which I am desirous of offering, in this
place, on the subject of Diet; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i>—that in all cases of feeble or imperfect
digestion, <em>the Valetudinarian ought never to take his principal meal in a state of
fatigue</em>—and yet let me ask, whether there is a habit more generally pursued,
or more tenaciously defended? Aye, and defended too upon <em>principle</em>—the
invalid merchant, the banker, the attorney, the government clerk,
are all impressed with the same belief, that after the sedentary occupations
of the day, to walk several miles to their villas, or to fatigue themselves with
exercise before their dinner, or rather early supper, will sharpen their tardy
stomachs, and invigorate their feeble organs of digestion. The consequence
is obvious,—instead of curing, such a practice is calculated to perpetuate,
and even to aggravate the malady under which they suffer; by
calling upon the powers of digestion at a period, when the body is in a
state of exhaustion from fatigue. Often have I, in the course of my practice
in this town, cured the Dyspeptic invalid, by merely inducing him to
abandon so mischievous a habit.</p>

  <h4 class='c034'>II.<br /> TO CORRECT THE OPERATION OF THE BASIS, BY OBVIATING ANY UNPLEASANT EFFECTS IT MIGHT BE LIKELY TO OCCASION, AND WHICH WOULD PERVERT ITS INTENDED ACTION, AND DEFEAT THE OBJECTS OF ITS EXHIBITION.</h4>
</div>

<h5 class='c044'>A. <em>By</em> <span class='sc'>Mechanically</span> <em>separating, or</em> <span class='sc'>Chemically</span> <em>neutralizing, the offending Ingredient</em>.</h5>

<p class='c018'>The scientific physician, from his knowledge of the chemical composition
of a medicine, and of the principles upon which its different qualities
depend, is enabled to remove or render inert the element which imparts to
it a deleterious operation; thus it has been found that the peculiar principle
in the <em>Spanish Fly</em>, which so frequently irritates the urinary organs, is
soluble in boiling water; ebullition in water therefore offers the means of
depriving it of the power of thus acting upon the kidneys, while it does not
effect any alteration in its vesicatory properties. It is upon the same principle
that many vegetable substances of a very acrid nature, become harmless
by boiling, or by chemical manipulation, and some of them might even
in times of scarcity and want, be introduced as wholesome and nutritious
articles of diet. The experiments of <em>Westring</em> shew that the bitterness of
the <em>Lichen Islandicus</em> may be entirely removed by maceration in an alkaline
ley, and a tasteless, but highly nutritious fecula be thus obtained; in
the same manner the <em>Æsculus Hippocastanum</em> (Horse Chesnut) may be
deprived of its bitterness, leaving a residuum which will afford a kind of
bread; and according to <em>Parmentier</em> (<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recherches sur les vegetaux nourissans</span></cite>,)
excellent starch may be also made from it. <em>Dr. Darwin</em> observes, that if
the roots of <em>White Bryony</em> be rasped into cold water, and agitated with it,
the acrid juice of the root along with the mucilage will be dissolved, or
swim in the water; while a starch perfectly wholesome and nutritious will
subside, and may be advantageously used as food; by a similar species of
address the French prepare from the acrid <em>Arum</em> the harmless, but highly
prized cosmetic, called <em>Cyprus powder</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are many substances which receive a much pleasanter mode of
operation by having their solubilities increased or diminished; thus the
griping occasioned by several drastic purgatives is obviated by the addition
of some alkali: and the nauseating tendency of <em>Camboge</em>, which arises
from its too easy solubility, is prevented by incorporating it with some insoluble
body; as in the <em>Pilulæ Cambogiæ Comp:</em> but the farther consideration
of this question will be resumed in the fourth section of the Analysis.
(iv. c.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Numerous attempts have been made to correct the inconvenient effects
of <em>Opium</em>, such as nausea, head-ache, and costiveness, by removing the
resinous element, upon which such evils have been supposed to depend,
and we have accordingly been at different times presented with a variety
of <em>Formulæ</em> for the accomplishment of so desirable an object; (<em>see Opium</em>).
More recently, opium has been discovered to possess <em>two</em> active principles,
viz. <em>Morphia</em> and <em>Narcotine</em>, which would appear from the researches of
M. Majendie to exert very different powers upon the animal system; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>former imparting to opium its <em>soporific</em>, the latter, its <em>exciting</em> property;
whence it is proposed to remove this latter principle in order to render the
operation of opium milder, and at the same time to divest it of those objectionable
properties which so greatly limit its medicinal utility. <em>See
Opium.</em></p>

<h5 class='c044'>B. <em>By adding some substance capable of guarding the stomach, or system, against its deleterious effects.</em></h5>

<p class='c018'>The virtues of our most important remedies are frequently lost, or much
invalidated, for want of proper attention to the circumstances comprehended
in this section. It may be almost admitted as an axiom that <em>whenever
an</em> <span class='fss'>ALTERATIVE</span> <em>medicine acts with violence upon the primæ viæ, its energies
are uselessly expended, and the object of its exhibition defeated</em>. So again,
<em>Diaphoretics</em>, <em>Diuretics</em>, and many other remedies, suffer a diminution in
their effects, whenever they stimulate the stomach or bowels to excess.
<em>Guaiacum</em> thus loses its anti-arthritic, <em>Squill</em> its diuretic, and <em>Antimony</em> and
<em>Ipecacuan</em> their diaphoretic, virtues; the action of these substances may
therefore require correction, and a medicine must be selected capable of
fulfilling that intention. <em>Opium</em> has very extensive powers as a corrigent.
<em>See Form. 57, 100, 106, 110</em>. Dr. Mead combined alkaline salts, when
intended to act as diuretics, with opium, in order to prevent their action upon
the bowels. <em>Acetate of Lead</em>, when administered in cases of hæmopthysis, or
uterine hemorrhage, should also be guarded by the addition of a small portion
of the same narcotic. Dr. Sutton, of Greenwich, has lately written a paper
to shew, that where we wish to limit the operation of an emetic to the
stomach, and to prevent its action on the bowels, we should add five or
six drops of laudanum to the emetic draught, which in his experience has
answered the purpose in question.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c015'><sup>[259]</sup></a> The griping and nauseating tendency
of some remedies receives correction by the addition of <em>Aromatic stimulants</em>,
or <em>Essential oils</em>, (69, 71, 78, 84, 85, 92,) or by small portions of a
corresponding tincture, (70, 76.) It has been already stated, that the
griping from <em>Senna</em> and <em>resinous</em> purgatives may be, in a great degree,
obviated by the addition of alkalies; it remains to be observed, that the
same remedies are also mitigated in severity, by <em>saline</em> purgatives, (77.)
I learn from Sir Henry Halford, that in his practice he has found the addition
of <em>Extract of Hyoscyamus</em> render the operation of the <em>compound extract
of Colocynth</em> much more mild, and no less efficacious. Of the value
of such a combination, I am myself able to bear ample testimony. <em>Alum</em>
is corrected in its tendency to disturb the bowels by the addition of <em>Nutmeg</em>,
(<em>Form. 53</em>,) or some aromatic; and the drastic operation of <em>Colocynth</em> may
be mitigated by trituration with <em>Camphor</em>. There are several substances
which are deprived of their acrimonious qualities by trituration with mucilage,
milk, barley-water, &amp;c. The tendency which mercurial preparations
possess of affecting the bowels, is, with the exception of <em>Corrosive
Sublimate</em>, corrected by <em>Opium</em>, but the acrid operation of this latter salt
is more securely guarded against by the decoction of <em>Guaiacum</em> or <em>Mezereon</em>,
or by the plentiful exhibition of mucilaginous drinks and broths. In
certain diseases of the uterus and vagina, astringent lotions are indicated,
but it may happen, as in the cauliflower excrescence, or in the oozing tumour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>of the labium, that such applications are too irritating; in such cases
the effect of the lotion is <em>corrected</em> by the addition of mucilage. The enfeebling
influence of <em>Digitalis</em>, <em>Tobacco</em>, and some other narcotics, is successfully
opposed by aromatics and stimulants. It has already been stated
that several attempts have been made to correct the operation of <em>Opium</em>
by the application of mechanical and chemical resources; it would, however,
appear that, for obviating its effects upon the intestinal excretions,
the judicious addition of some purgative will offer the most effectual corrigent;
and, according to my own experience, the <em>Aloetic</em> preparations are
to be preferred upon such an occasion, as in <em>Form. 11, 12, 13</em>. In some
cases, I have found that a combination of the watery infusion of <em>Opium</em>
with some bitter, will secure the narcotic virtues without those consecutive
effects upon the alimentary canal, which we are always so desirous to obviate;
the <em>Decoctum Aloes compositum</em> also furnishes upon such an occasion
a very appropriate adjunct. Let us remember that one of the effects of
opium is to paralyse, for a time, the muscular fibres of the intestines: now
experience has taught us that the remedies above directed have a peculiar
tendency to augment the peristaltic motions of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>. Upon
the same principle the addition of calomel will prevent the paralysing influence
of this narcotic upon the biliary functions. I have known several
patients who could never take opium unless in such a form of combination.</p>

<p class='c007'>In general, a formula contains but one <em>corrigent</em>; but circumstances
may occur, where two different ingredients are required to obviate two
very different effects, as in <em>Form. 16</em>, in which the <em>Nitric acid</em> is introduced
for the purpose of counteracting the deleterious effects of the opium upon
the nervous system, while the <em>Aloetic</em> preparation is calculated to obviate
its particular tendency upon the alimentary canal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes the unpleasant or perverse operation of a medicine may be
obviated by changing the form of its exhibition, the period at which it is
taken, or the extent of its dose; Dr. Cullen, for instance, found that the
nauseating operation of <em>Camboge</em> might be obviated, by repeating small
doses at short intervals. (89.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Before quitting the present subject, it deserves notice, that there is frequently
a <em>chemical</em> condition of the stomach that may interfere with the
mild operation of a medicine, and may therefore require consideration:
this is particularly exemplified in the action of those antimonial preparations
which are liable to become emetic and drastic by the presence of an
acid; it is, for this reason, very eligible to guard such substances with antacid
adjuncts. See <em>Antimonii Sulphuretum</em>, and <em>Form. 125, 128</em>. There
is also, upon some occasions, an irritable state of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i> depending
upon a deficient secretion of mucus, which renders even small doses of
any active medicine mischievous; mucilaginous decoctions in such a case
will offer the readiest <em>corrigent</em>; see <em>Scammonia</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vinous infusion of <em>Colchicum</em> appears to act more violently when
acid is present in the stomach; small doses of <em>Magnesia</em> may therefore
precede, and accompany its exhibition, with advantage.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>
  <h4 class='c034'>III.<br /> TO OBTAIN THE JOINT OPERATION OF TWO OR MORE MEDICINES.</h4>
</div>

<h5 class='c044'>A. <em>By uniting those substances which are calculated to produce the</em> <span class='fss'>SAME ULTIMATE RESULTS</span>, <em>although by totally different modes of operation</em>.</h5>

<p class='c018'>It has been already stated, (<em>page 152</em>), that we may frequently combine
substances together whose modes of operation are dissimilar, with considerable
advantage, provided they be not physiologically incompatible with
each other. We may illustrate this subject by a reference to the operation
of purgatives; a series of medicinal substances may be produced,
each of which has the property of exciting catharsis, but by a very different
mode of action; one for instance stimulates the muscular fibres of
the intestines; a second acts upon the exhalant vessels, and mucous
glands; and a third exerts its influence upon the neighbouring organs, so
as to produce an increased flow of their secretions into the bowels; but
since such modes of action are quite compatible with each other, they may
be simultaneously established, not only without any loss of efficacy, but
with the most decided advantage; suppose, for instance, we administer a
substance which, either from its insolubility or peculiar nature, acts exclusively
upon the muscular fibres of the alimentary canal, its peristaltic
motions will be undoubtedly thus increased, and the contents of the
bowels evacuated, but the operation will be slow, and probably accompanied
with considerable <em>tormina</em>; now it is evident that if to such a remedy
we add those which can produce an increased flow of serous fluids,
the effect will be both quicker and easier. <em>The infusion of Senna</em> is thus
quickened and corrected by <em>Soluble Tartar</em>. In the same manner various
substances included in the class of diuretics, which, although different,
still if they be not adverse in their operation, may be conjoined; <em>Digitalis</em>
and <em>Potass</em> are not similar, nor are they incompatible, for while the alkali,
through the medium of the circulation, stimulates the secreting organs of
the kidneys, the foxglove may, by its sympathetic action, rouse the energy
of the absorbents. In the administration of diaphoretics we shall frequently
derive additional force, as well as certainty, by combining those
which act by relaxing the cutaneous emunctories, with those which
prove diaphoretic by imparting a general increase of momentum to the
blood.</p>

<h5 class='c044'>B. <em>By combining Medicines which have entirely different powers, and which are required to obviate different symptoms, or to answer different indications.</em></h5>

<p class='c018'>Arrangements constructed upon this principle constitute some of the
most valuable remedies with which we are acquainted; they are in general
<em>extemporaneous</em>, because their value depends upon their being varied
and modified according to the symptoms and circumstances of each particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>case. The following general elucidation of the subject may serve
to demonstrate the nature and importance of such combinations.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Purgatives</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Antispasmodics</span>. The practice suggested by Drs.
Stoll and Warren, in the treatment of <em>Cholica Pictonum</em>, affords a striking
example of the expediency of combinations of this nature. It is found
in that disease, as well as in others attended with spasmodic constriction
of the intestinal canal, that purgatives produce no effects unless the spasm
be allayed by combining them with <em>Opium</em>, (<em>see Form. 71, 75, 76</em>,) it is
from such a cause that the purgative so popular with tailors and shoemakers,
and which consists of <em>Aloes</em> with <em>Sagapenum</em> or <em>Galbanum</em>, affords
such prompt relief in the spasmodic cholic to which they are subject.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Purgatives</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Tonics</span>. In the exhibition of cathartics how frequently
it occurs in practice that the patient’s strength will hardly allow
the evacuation; in such a case the addition of <em>steel</em> as a roborant (<em>Form.
72, 92, 93</em>,) or even of <em>æther</em>, or <em>ammonia</em>, as a diffusible stimulant, is
strongly indicated: the Cheltenham waters offer a natural combination of
this character. So again in the cure of dropsy we have often two indications
to fulfil—to evacuate the water, and to support the strength of the
patient; hence the necessity of combining brisk and stimulating purges,
such as <em>Scammony</em>, <em>Jalap</em>, &amp;c. with active tonics, (83.) In the treatment
of amenorrhæa the same medicinal arrangement is not unfrequently indicated.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Purgatives</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Mercurial Alteratives</span>. In habitual costiveness,
where there appears to be a deficiency of bile, a combination of <em>Pilula
Hydrargyri</em>, with certain <em>Aloetic</em> compounds, may prove serviceable; for
while the latter remedy will, in the absence of bile, supply to the intestines
a congenial stimulus, the former will tend to restore the bilious secretion
by its influence upon the hepatic system. <em>See Form. 79, 81</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Purgatives</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Diaphoretics</span>. This combination of effects is often
useful in practice, but it is desirable that the latter should not be established
until the operation of the purgative upon the bowels has subsided. This
is accomplished by certain doses of <em>Tartarized Antimony</em> in conjunction
with some purgative. The <em>Pulvis Aloes Compositus</em> of our Pharmacopœia
produces a somewhat similar effect.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Diaphoretics</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Tonics</span>. How frequently is the practitioner desirous
of determining to the skin, and at the same time of supporting the
strength of the general system? in the progress of a continued fever we
are repeatedly called upon to fulfil such indications. Dr. Bree<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c015'><sup>[260]</sup></a> also observes
that “in the exhibition of <em>Diaphoretics</em> the addition of a bitter infusion,
or tincture, is frequently proper; for the stomach should be gently
excited and strengthened during the use of a diaphoretic draught.” On
the other hand, <em>Tonics</em> not unfrequently require the aid of a diaphoretic;
for instance, in the cure of <em>Cynanche maligna</em>, the use of bark is indicated;
but if the skin be hot and dry, it should be accompanied with a diaphoretic.
<em>See Form. 126</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Antispasmodics</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Tonics</span>, <em>or</em> <span class='sc'>Narcotics</span>. Under the history of
Antispasmodics, (<em>page 78</em>) it is stated that there are certain bodies which
seem to exert an absolute control over inordinate muscular action, from
whatever general cause it may have arisen; in administering such remedies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>however, the intelligent practitioner will not overlook the peculiar
condition of the system in its relations to the disease; where debility is
present, the <em>Antispasmodic</em> will be usefully combined with a <em>Tonic</em>; and,
in certain morbid states of the nervous system, with a <em>Narcotic</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Astringents</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Diaphoretics</span>. Dr. Fordyce has observed, that
combinations of this kind are often indicated in cases of Diarrhœa, where
it is necessary to astringe the vessels of the intestines, and at the same
time to relax those of the skin; such an indication, he says, may be fulfilled
by exhibiting <em>Tormentil root</em>, or any other vegetable astringent, with
<em>Ipecacuan</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Astringents</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Narcotics</span>, and <span class='sc'>Absorbents</span>. It has been already
observed, that in a Diarrhœa, depending upon the influx of acrid
fluids into the intestines, there are three modes of treatment by which the
malady may be obviated, viz. by a narcotic, <em>diminishing the irritability of
the intestines</em>; by an astringent, <em>restraining the serous excretion</em>; and by
an absorbent, <em>neutralizing the acrid matter</em>. As the modes of action are
not incompatible with each other, they maybe simultaneously established
with the greatest advantage. <em>See Form. 52</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Astringents</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Tonics</span>. A combination of certain medicines belonging
to these two classes is frequently indicated; in the treatment of
passive hemorrhage, we have to astringe the bleeding vessels, and, at
the same time, to cure the hemorrhagic diathesis by remedies which are
capable of restoring the general tone of the system. In the treatment
of the chronic and humid coughs of old persons, I have very frequently
witnessed the beneficial union of the warm and stimulating influence of
<em>Myrrh</em> with the astringent effects of <em>Sulphate of Zinc</em>. <em>Form. 69</em> presents
the combination which I have usually adopted with success on such occasions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Diuretics</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Tonics</span>. As Dropsy is frequently associated with
great debility, the practitioner should combine his diuretics with some
tonic medicine; but in forming a judgment upon the case he must be
guided by those precepts which have been laid down under the consideration
of Diuretics at page 97. See <em>Form. 114</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Diuretics</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Aromatic Stimulants</span>. Such a combination will be
found advantageous in those cases where the powers of the system require
to be excited by more prompt measures than those afforded by the
agency of tonics. <em>Ethereal</em> preparations, with Squill and other stimulating
diuretics, are well calculated upon such occasions to afford valuable assistance.
<em>Form. 101–116.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tonics</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Diffusible Stimulants</span>. In the cure of dyspepsia, we
frequently require a remedy, for the purpose of obviating debility, that is
more sudden in its action, and prompt in its effects, than that of a bitter
<em>tonic</em>, whose operation is almost imperceptible; while the case may at the
same time stand in need of that permanent increase of tone, which the
latter remedy can alone supply; such an indication therefore must be fulfilled
by combination. <em>Form. 40, 42.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tonics</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Purgatives</span>. In the exhibition of tonic medicines it is
frequently essential to accompany their operation with purgation; in intermittent
fevers, for instance, when attended with a redundant secretion of
bile, or any obstruction of the viscera, the <em>bark</em> must be given in combination
with some laxative, for which purpose Boerhaave has recommended
<em>Muriate of Ammonia</em>; <em>Mead</em>, <em>Rhubarb</em>; whilst in many cases, experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>suggests the propriety of selecting some of the warmer cathartics, especially
the Alöetic: and I shall take this opportunity to observe, that notwithstanding
the opinion so strongly expressed by Sydenham, that “<em>to add
any thing to the bark argues either ignorance or craft</em>,” the most respectable
testimony may be adduced to demonstrate the great advantages which
have arisen from the various combinations of this heroic remedy.
Sir George Baker has said that “<em>there is less of reason than of severity</em>,” in
the above remark of Sydenham; for that it was found in the cure of the
intermittent fever, which he describes, that, according to circumstances,
sometimes the <em>Virginian snake root</em>, and in other cases <em>Myrrh</em>, were added
with propriety and advantage; and, according to the experience of several
practitioners, a drachm of the <em>rust of iron</em>, and the same quantity of
the powder of <em>black pepper</em>, added to each ounce of <em>bark</em>, were the means
of subduing the most inveterate agues. <em>Formula 44</em> presents a combination,
which we learn from Dr. Petrie’s letter to Sir George Baker, constitutes
a celebrated Dutch remedy for an ague, and which was tried with
success in the hospital at Lincoln, in those obstinate intermittents which
prevailed in the year 1781. Hillary speaks of an epidemic intermittent at
Barbadoes, in which the bark was of no avail, unless combined with saline
remedies, or some of the tonic bitters. Dr. Barton has stated that
Bark combined with Mercury in a small proportion, is one of the best remedies
for removing the swelling of the spleen after an intermittent.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Expectorants</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Diffusible Stimulants</span>. We have seen that
expectorants may be usefully associated with tonics; it sometimes occurs
that these remedies require the addition of some diffusible stimulant. In
certain states of <em>Peripneumonia notha</em>, where the powers of life are ebbing,
and the lungs become inundated with viscid mucus, I have experienced the
value of a combination of some stimulating expectorant and <em>ammonia</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Antacids</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Tonics</span>. In the cure of cardialgia we have obviously
two indications; to neutralize the offending acid by some chemical agent,
and to correct the morbid state of the digestive functions by some appropriate
remedy. <em>See Form. 152</em>. The same observation will apply in the
treatment of certain cases of chlorosis, where cardialgia is not unfrequently
a very vexatious attendant, and solicits the union of emmenagogues
with antacids, or absorbents, as in <em>Form. 99</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lithonthryptics</span> <em>with</em> <span class='sc'>Narcotics</span>. As a palliative in calculous irritation,
the union of alkalies and opium proves a valuable resource. Henbane
may likewise be advantageously combined with a Lithonthryptic;
for, be it remembered, that few narcotics are more efficacious in allaying
nephritic irritation. (<em>Form. 156.</em>) We have also frequently two important
indications to fulfil in the treatment of urinary concretions; where the
lithic acid diathesis prevails, it will be necessary to neutralize any acidity
in the first passages, and at the same time to regulate the functions of the
skin; we have moreover to give tone to the digestive organs; so that, in
such cases, the art of medicinal combination is well calculated to extend
our resources.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the formation of these compounds we should rarely attempt to fulfil
more than two indications, although cases may occur in which it will be
eligible to assail the disease with an engine of <em>triple</em> powers, as exemplified
by <em>Form. 52</em> .</p>

<p class='c007'>In constructing, however, such complex arrangements the practitioner
must of course take care that he does not fall into the error of <span class='sc'>Contraindication</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>and combine substances which possess properties essentially
different, and which are at variance with, or directly opposed to each
other; it is an error of the most serious description, and unfortunately is
one of too common occurrence in the lower walks of medical practice;
“<em>crimine ab uno disce omnes</em>.” I lately met with a country practitioner
who, upon being asked by a lady whom he attended, the intention of
three different draughts which he had sent her, replied, that one would
warm, the second cool her, and that the third was calculated to moderate
the too violent effects of either; thus it is that discredit and contempt fall
upon the use of medicines, which ought only to attach to the ignorant
pretenders, or designing knaves who administer them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having, in the commencement of this inquiry, stated that all the principles
of combination, capable of practical application in the construction
of extemporaneous formulæ, are exemplified in the composition of the various
productions of Nature, I shall conclude the present section by shewing,
that <em>many of our most valuable vegetables owe their useful properties to
the joint operation of the several distinct and different ingredients which enter
into their composition</em>. How many substances does Nature produce in the
vegetable kingdom, in which the permanent tonic quality of bitterness exerts
its influence in union with the transient stimulating powers of an
aromatic principle? indeed there is a series of vegetable remedies of this
kind: commencing with those that are simply bitter, we gradually proceed
through the different species, each blending as we advance an increasing
proportion of aroma, until we arrive at those in which the aromatic
quality greatly preponderates. <em>Peruvian Bark</em> may be said to combine
within itself the properties of <em>bitterness</em>, <em>astringency</em>, and <em>aroma</em>; a
fact which suggested the probability of our being able to produce an artificial
compound that might emulate the effects of Cinchona, and to a certain
extent the idea appears to have been realised; for we are told by Dr.
Cullen, that he frequently succeeded in the cure of an intermittent by a
combination of <em>Oak Bark</em> and <em>Gentian</em>, when neither bitters nor astringents,
separately, produced the least impression; and I am informed by
Dr. Harrison, that in the Horncastle Dispensary, of which he was for many
years physician, he never employed any other remedy for curing the
ague of Lincolnshire than equal parts of <em>Bistorta</em> (astringent) and <em>Calamus
Aromaticus</em> (bitter and aromatic), neither of which plants, <em>individually</em>,
ever produced the least benefit in such diseases. Berzelius attempted to
produce a compound of this description by adding to the bark of the <em>Ash</em>
some <em>Tormentil root</em> and <em>Ginger</em>; and he observes that it acted as an excellent
tonic, and that according to the experiments of his friends it seemed
to cure quartan agues.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c015'><sup>[261]</sup></a> In the aromatic barks and woods, such as
those of the <em>Canella</em>, <em>Orange-peel</em>, <em>Sassafras</em>, &amp;c. the aromatic principle<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c015'><sup>[262]</sup></a>
is combined with a bitter ingredient; a union which proves of singular
service in the formidable bowel complaints so common in tropical climates.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great superiority of the hop, as an ingredient in our malt liquors,
depends upon the fact of its containing within itself several distinct and independent
elements of activity, which the other bitter herbs that have at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>different times been employed as its substitute, do not possess. The philosophy
of its operation may be adduced as a striking illustration of the
present subject; first, then, it contains a <em>bitter</em> principle, which imparts to
the beverage a tonic quality and an agreeable flavour; while at the same
time an <em>aromatic</em> ingredient adds a warm and stimulant property and modifies
the bitterness; the hop, moreover, contains an <em>astringent</em> ingredient
(<em>Tannin</em> and <em>Gallic Acid</em>), the effects of which are to precipitate the vegetable
mucilage, and thus to remove from the beer the active principle of
its fermentation; every attempt therefore to substitute an ordinary bitter
for that of the hop must necessarily fail, unless a compound can be so artfully
constructed as to contain in due proportions, the principles of bitterness,
astringency, and aroma. <em>Quassia</em> must therefore necessarily prove
but a sorry substitute; it will impart bitterness enough, but it will not be
modified by agreeable aroma; and as it contains no astringent principle,
it will fail in precipitating the vegetable mucilage, or gluten; in consequence
of which the beer so manufactured will be in a perpetual state of
fermentation until it is entirely spoilt.<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c015'><sup>[263]</sup></a> <em>Rhubarb</em> is another medical plant
which may be brought forward in elucidation of the analogies subsisting
between natural and artificial combinations; in this case Nature has presented
us with a singular and most important union of medicinal powers,—that
of an astringent, with a cathartic property! virtues, which we might,
without the light of experience, have pronounced to be incompatible with
each other; and yet we find that in this instance the property of astringency
never interferes with, or opposes the purgative force, since the former
does not display itself unless the substance be administered in small
doses; or, when given in larger ones, not until it has ceased to operate as
a cathartic.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>IV.<br /> TO OBTAIN A NEW AND ACTIVE REMEDY NOT AFFORDED BY ANY SINGLE SUBSTANCE.</h4>

<h5 class='c044'>A. <em>By combining medicines which excite different actions in the Stomach and System, in consequence of which</em> <span class='sc'>New</span>, <em>or modified results, are produced.</em></h5>

<p class='c018'>This constitutes by far the most obscure part of the subject of medicinal
combination, and must ever continue so until we become better acquainted
with the laws which govern the action of medicinal substances upon
the living system. That the most valuable effects, however, are really
produced by such arrangements, we have the testimony of long experience,
and examples are furnished in the valuable and well-known operation
of many officinal preparations; thus the “<em>Pulvis Ipecacuanhæ compositus</em>”
contains as its active elements, <em>Opium</em> and <em>Ipecacuanha</em>; and yet, in
well regulated doses, it neither possesses the narcotic operation of the former,
nor the nauseating effects of the latter; they appear to be mutually
lost, and converted into a powerful diaphoretic: so again, the emetic operation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>of <em>Sulphuret of Antimony</em>, and the specific influence of <em>Calomel</em>, are
changed by combination with each other, giving rise to a remedy eminently
distinguished for its powers as an alterative. Dr. Bree observes that
<em>Tincture of Squills</em> combined with <em>Extract of Henbane</em>, and the <em>Nitric Acid</em>,
have been proved by much experience to be expectorant and sedative in a
paroxysm of asthma, although each article, uncombined, had been given
without success. See <em>Form. 139</em>. The efficacy of <em>Hemlock</em>, in quieting
Pulmonary irritation, has been frequently adverted to in the course of this
work; I have to state, in this place, that its value, on such occasions, is
generally enhanced by combination with <em>Ipecacuanha</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is probable that many of our natural remedies owe their efficacy to
the results of a similar species of combination. In the fourth edition of
this work it was stated that, according to the assertion of Dr. Chapman,
“<em>Kino</em>, when administered in union with <em>Calumba</em>, constituted a pretty
certain, and powerful purgative;” since the publication of this fact, I have
investigated what, if true, would appear to be a most extraordinary anomaly
in the philosophy of medicinal combination, and I find that the statement
of Dr. Chapman<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c015'><sup>[264]</sup></a> is not borne out by experiment. That we might
arrive at a just conclusion upon this subject, I requested the assistance of
my friend Dr. John Davy, whose character for experimental accuracy,
and whose situation as Superintendant of the Medical Division of the General
Military Hospital at Chatham, seemed to point him out as a person
peculiarly adapted for such an inquiry; the result of his trials does not
establish that of the experiments of Dr. Chapman, but on the contrary it
seems to prove, that neither <em>Kino</em> nor <em>Calumba</em>, when taken separately,
has a constipating effect, and that in the form of powder (especially the
<em>Calumba</em>) each has an aperient quality, which is not increased by exhibiting
the two medicines together in a state of mixture. The trials from
which these inferences are drawn were made on different individuals in
tolerable health, and they were repeated more than once; in some cases
they were given separately, and in others, mixed together, in doses varying
from a scruple to a drachm of each.</p>

<h5 class='c044'>B. <em>By combining Substances which have the property of acting chemically upon each other; the result of which is the formation of</em> <span class='sc'>new Compounds</span>, <em>or the decomposition of the original Ingredients, and the developement of their more</em> <span class='sc'>active Elements</span>.</h5>

<h5 class='c044'>A. <em>The Formation of New Compounds.</em></h5>

<p class='c018'>It is not necessary to extend our researches beyond the range of the
Pharmacopœiæ,<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c015'><sup>[265]</sup></a> to collect a variety of interesting and important examples,
in illustration of this division of our subject; if we require a striking
example of the agency of chemical combination in destroying the identity
of the original constituents, and of giving origin to a compound of new
powers, it may be exemplified by the well known instance of <em>Sulphate of
Potass</em>, a substance possessing but a weak affinity for water, and exerting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>but little energy upon the animal œconomy; whereas the two ingredients
of which it consists are distinguished for the extreme eagerness with which
they unite with water, and for the caustic activity which they display in
their action upon animal matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under this head the class of metals will also present itself to our consideration,
all the individuals of which, with the exception perhaps of iron,
are perfectly inert and harmless; even arsenic, lead, copper, and mercury,
which in certain states of combination constitute some of the most virulent
of known substances, exert no action upon the living system, unless
they be in union with some other body; but when so united, how valuable
do they become, and what various medicinal effects may they not be
made to produce.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Acetic Acid</em> and <em>Ammonia</em> become neutralized by combination with
each other, affording a compound of new virtues. <em>Sulphate of Zinc</em>, and
<em>Acetate of Lead</em>, when mixed together in solution, decompose each other,
and the <em>Acetate of Zinc</em> which is formed, affords a more valuable remedy
than either of the former salts, as an application in ophthalmia. The
“<em>Mistura Ferri Composita</em>” of our Pharmacopœia offers another example
of the same chemical resource. I also beg the reader to refer to the construction
of <em>Formula 82</em>, which presents an instance of a purgative draught
being produced by combination, in which the original properties of every
element are entirely changed. See also <em>Formula 87</em>, the chemical actions
of which are more complicated, but no less instructive than the preceding
one; the ingredients of the formula are the <em>Carbonates of Soda</em> and <em>Magnesia</em>,—<em>Sulphate
of Iron</em>,—<em>Diluted Sulphuric Acid</em>, and <em>Water</em>—and when
mixed together, the following decompositions would appear to take place;
the free <em>Sulphuric Acid</em>, together with that which exists in the <em>Sulphate of
Iron</em>, being just sufficient to decompose the <em>Carbonates of Soda</em> and <em>Magnesia</em>,
forms two neutral <em>Sulphates</em> (viz. <em>Sulphates of Soda</em> and <em>Magnesia</em>,)
and thereby disengages a volume of <em>Carbonic Acid gas</em>, which not only
increases the purgative operation of the new saline compounds, but, by its
excess, holds in solution the <em>Carbonate of Iron</em>, which is formed by the decomposition
of the <em>Sulphate</em>, and which in that state displays an effect powerfully
tonic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before we quit the consideration of medicinal compounds as the results
of chemical action, it is expedient to remind the practitioner of the essential
difference between <em>Mixture</em> and <em>Combination</em>, a difference which affects
the medicinal virtues no less than the chemical characters of bodies; it is
determined by ample experience, that substances will produce effects upon
the living system when presented in a state of simple mechanical mixture,
very different from those which the same medicines will occasion when
they are combined by the agency of chemical affinity, as is well exemplified
in the comparative effects of alcohol as existing in ardent spirits, and
in wine (see <em>Vinum</em>); or in the relative powers of <em>Mercury</em> in the <em>Unguentum
Hydrargyri</em> of the London College, and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unguentum Oxidi Hydrargyri
cinerei</span></i> of the Pharmacopœia of Edinburgh, (see <em>Unguent. Hydrargyri</em>);
the former of which is a true chemical compound, whereas the latter
is a simple mixture of its ingredients.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h5 class='c044'>B. <em>The Developement of Active Elements.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The accomplishment of such an effect is in many instances the sole object
of a pharmaceutical process. It is thus that we obtain pure <em>Citric
acid</em> from the juice of the Lemon; <em>Tartaric acid</em>, from Cream of Tartar;
<em>Benzoic acid</em>, from the resinous substance known by the name of <em>Gum
Benzoin</em>; upon the same principle, the <em>Muriatic</em> and <em>Nitric</em> acids are elicited
from the saline compounds in which they exist. <em>Ammonia</em>, in its pungent
form, is developed from its inodorous <em>Muriate</em>; and the fixed alkalies
are obtained in their caustic state, from the comparatively mild <em>carbonates</em>
in which they naturally exist. But a more striking and instructive instance
of the effect of chemical action, in developing an active, or useful
principle, cannot perhaps be selected than that of the well known stimulant
Plaister, composed of <em>Muriate of Ammonia</em>, <em>Soap</em>, and <em>Lead Plaister</em>, in
which the alkali of soap enters into combination with the muriatic acid,
when the <em>Ammonia</em>, upon which the virtues of the plaister solely depend,
is slowly disengaged in the form of gas, producing a powerfully rubifacient
and stimulant effect: the “<em>Cataplasma Fermenti</em>,” or “<em>Yeast Poultice</em>,”
is indebted for its antiseptic properties to a similar agency, for they do not
depend upon any virtue in the ingredients themselves, but upon their decomposition,
and the consequent developement of an active element, which
is <em>Carbonic Acid</em>. The practitioner unacquainted with the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i>
of these combinations, would inevitably fall into an error by which their
efficacy must be lost; he would hardly apply them as soon as they were
formed, nor would he be aware of the necessity of repeating them at short
intervals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The decomposition of <em>Calomel</em> by lime water, forming the well known
“<em>black wash</em>” and that of <em>corrosive sublimate</em> in the same fluid, constituting
the “<em>aqua phagadenica</em>,” furnish remedies which derive all their peculiar
efficacy from the developement of the mercury in different states of oxidation.
The reader will find another, and a very striking illustration of the
same principle in the history of “<em>Alterative Drops</em>,” under the article
“<em>Hydrargyri Oxy-murias</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A substance separated by chemical precipitation is often a valuable remedy,
being in a much more subtle and impalpable form than any body
can be rendered by mechanical triture and levigation;<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c015'><sup>[266]</sup></a> for example, the
<em>Carbonate of Lead</em>, (Cerussa), when diffused in water, is according to the
experience of our best surgeons, far less active as a topical application than
the same substance when produced at once by precipitation from the <em>Sub-acetate</em>
of that metal. In some cases, also, the substance obtained by precipitation
is in a different state of oxidation from that which is prepared by
a different process, see <em>Mist. Ferri Comp:</em> It is a question well worthy of
consideration whether a more active preparation of the <em>Antimonial powder</em>
might not be formed by obtaining the oxide by the precipitation of <em>Tartarized
Antimony</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many interesting and important illustrations have been lately afforded
by an extended knowledge of vegetable chemistry, recent analyses having
developed principles of extreme activity from several of our most esteemed
plants; thus have Sertuerner and Robiquet succeeded in separating a narcotic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>element from <em>Opium</em> (<em>Morphia</em>); Majendie, and <em>Pelletier</em>, an emetic
principle from <em>Ipecacuan</em>, (<em>Emeta</em>); and the last mentioned chemist, together
with Caventou, a tonic one from <em>Peruvian Bark</em>, (<em>Cinchonia</em>), the properties
and applications of which will be fully explained hereafter, under
the history of the different substances which contain them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is only here necessary to caution the practitioner against those fallacies
into which the captivating theories of the chemist may seduce
him; and, if the views which I have offered upon the subject of combination
be correct, it will follow as a corollary, that the concentration <em>of an
active element must in many cases abridge its powers as a remedy</em>; for although
the matter thus removed may <em>individually</em> be quite inert, yet, in combination,
it may subdivide the particles of the essential constituent, or modify
its solubility, and give impulse and steadiness to its operation; thus the
vegetable alkali <em>Quina</em>, although it indisputably constitutes the active
matter of bark, will be found inefficacious when separated from it, unless
it be rendered soluble by the addition of sulphuric, or some other
acid.</p>

<h5 class='c044'>C. <em>By combining substances, between which no other chemical change is induced, than a diminution, or an increase, in the</em> <span class='sc'>Solubilities</span> <em>of the principles, which are the repositories of their medicinal virtues</em>.</h5>

<p class='c018'>The degree of solubility possessed by a medicinal substance may perhaps
be regarded by some practitioners as a circumstance of but little or no
importance; it will however appear in many cases that <em>it not only influences
the activity of a remedy, but, like its dose, goes far to determine its specific operation</em>;
indeed, where a medicine is not, in itself, very soluble, the increase
of its solubility by any chemical expedient, is tantamount to an increase
of its dose.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is probably owing to the diversity which exists in the solubility of the
active elements of certain purgatives, that so great a diversity occurs in
their operation; it is, for instance, easy to conceive that a medicine may
act more immediately and specially on the stomach, small, or large intestines,
according to the relative facility with which its principles of activity
enter into solution; that those which are dissolved before they pass the
pylorus are quick and violent in their effects, and liable to affect the stomach,
as is exemplified by the action of <em>Gamboge</em>, &amp;c. whilst some resinous
purgatives, on the other hand, as they contain principles less soluble,
seldom act until they have passed out of the stomach, and often not until
they have reached the colon. <em>Colocynth</em> has a wider range of operation,
since its principles of activity reside both in soluble and in insoluble elements.
<em>Aloes</em> again, being still further insoluble, pass through the whole
alimentary canal before they are sufficiently dissolved, and act therefore
more particularly upon the rectum, by which they are liable to produce
piles, tenesmus, and the various effects which so usually attend their operation.
The characteristic effects of <em>Rhubarb</em>, <em>Senna</em>, <em>Saline Cathartics</em>,
and indeed of all individual substances which compose the class of the
purgative medicines, will also admit of a satisfactory explanation from the
application of these views. It ought moreover to enable the practitioner,
by changing the solubilities of these substances, to change their medicinal
effects. Experience shews that this is the fact, and that it may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>effected either <em>by the intervention of substances that act</em> <span class='sc'>Chemically</span>; or, <em>by
the addition of Ingredients whose operation is entirely</em> <span class='sc'>Mechanical</span>; thus by
combining <em>Aloes</em> with <em>Soap</em> or an <em>Alkaline Salt</em>, we quicken their operation,
and remove their tendency to irritate the rectum; the <em>Compound Decoction
of Aloes</em> affords a combination of this kind. <em>Gamboge</em>, whose too ready
solubility it is an object to obviate, should be intimately incorporated with
some insoluble purgative, as for instance <em>Aloes</em>; a formula of this nature
was introduced by Dr. George Fordyce, and it has been since simplified
and admitted into our Pharmacopœia, under the title of “<em>Pilulæ Cambogiæ
Compositæ</em>.” <em>Tartrate of Potash</em>, which, on account of its comparative
solubility, has gained the name of <em>Soluble Tartar</em>, acts with corresponding
briskness upon the small intestines; but by increasing its proportion of
<em>Tartaric Acid</em>, we convert it into a <em>super-tartrate</em> or “<em>Cream of Tartar</em>,”
which is a substance characterized by a comparative degree of insolubility,
and a correspondent change is produced in the medicinal activity of the
salt; its purgative effects are considerably diminished, whilst its diuretic
powers are rendered more considerable. We may even extend this experiment
by adding to the <em>Cream of Tartar</em>, <em>Boracic Acid</em>, a substance capable
of increasing to a certain extent its solubility, when we shall again
find that its purgative properties are strengthened in an equal proportion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been observed that a mixture of different saline cathartics is more
efficient than an equivalent dose of any single one, a fact which is strikingly
exemplified in the prompt and active operation of Cheltenham
Salts, in comparatively small doses, as well as in that of sea water. I
submit whether this may not in some degree depend upon increased solubility;
for it is a law well known to the chemist, that <em>when water has ceased
to act upon a salt</em>, <em>in consequence of its having obtained the term of saturation,
the solution may still take up another salt of a different kind</em>. I apprehend
that an advantageous application of this law might be frequently made
in practice, and the energies of a remedy thereby considerably extended.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c015'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Where the active principle of a cathartic is not sufficiently soluble, it
is apt to vex and irritate the bowels, producing tormina instead of exciting
a free and copious excretion; hence the reason why the operation of resinous
purgatives is so commonly attended with griping, and why relief
may be obtained by combining them with <em>neutral salts</em>. Thus also <em>Senna</em>,
whose virtues reside in extractive matter, is apt by decoction, or long exposure
to the air, to act with griping, in consequence of the extractive
matter becoming by oxidation, resinous and comparatively insoluble:
this effect is best counteracted by the addition of <em>soluble Tartar</em>, that will
quicken its action, or by an alkaline salt that will increase its solubility.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears then to be established as a pharmaceutical maxim, that <em>the
intensity and even specific action of a purgative medicine may be modified or
completely changed</em>, <em>by changing the degree of solubility possessed by the principles
in which its activity resides</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The application of this principle is highly important in practice, directing
us in the choice of the different purgatives, according to the objects
which we may wish to fulfil by them, and pointing out safe and easy methods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>by which we may increase, diminish, retard, or accelerate their operation;
it thus enables us to construct new and powerful combinations, by
imparting to established remedies fresh activity, or by mitigating the acrimony
and violence of arrangements in other respects efficacious and eligible.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the exhibition of solid substances, their mechanical state of division
may be capable of modifying their operation, from the influence which
this condition must necessarily exert upon their solubilities, although I am
by no means disposed to assign to it the importance which Gaubius has
ventured to express, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sunt quæ ruditer pulverata alvum, subtilius vero urinas,
aut alios humores movent</span></i>;” and Ray, speaking of the <em>Asarum</em> (Hist. p.
208) has the following remark—“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quo tenuius est tritum, eo magis urinas
movere, minus autem alvum ducere creditur</span></i>;” and Linnæus<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c015'><sup>[268]</sup></a> observes that
this same plant, when exhibited in the state of <em>very fine</em> powder, uniformly
acts as an emetic, but that when <em>coarsely</em> powdered it always passes the
stomach, and becomes cathartic. M. Virey has made a similar observation
with respect to Hellebore,—“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Hellebore pulverisé fait vomiter; concassé
il purge; et en decoction prolongée, il en devient sudorifique ou diuretique.</span></i>”
I have endeavoured under the article <em>Pulveres</em> to establish some
useful precepts upon this subject, to which I beg to refer the reader.</p>

<p class='c007'>The influence of solubility upon the medicinal energies and specific effects
of remedies, may be farther illustrated by a comparative examination
of the virtues of the <em>Acetate</em> and <em>Sub-acetate</em> (Goulard’s Extract) <em>of
Lead:</em> the former preserves its solubility and integrity under any degree
of dilution, while the latter, when slightly diluted with the purest water,
in consequence of the carbonic acid diffused through it, gives out a copious
precipitate; the acetate therefore is undoubtedly the more immediately
active application as a preparation of lead, but it is nevertheless perhaps
less adapted to remove inflammation and abate irritation than the
turbid mixture of the sub-acetate, since the slow and gradual action which
is ensured by the latter is more desirable than the instantaneous operation
of the same remedy, applied in a more soluble form: the popular injection
for gonorrhæa, consisting of a mixed solution of <em>Sulphate of Zinc</em> and
<em>Acetate of Lead</em>, probably owes much of its value to the insoluble precipitate
of <em>Sulphate</em> of lead which necessarily takes place, and which, from
becoming entangled in the mucus of the urethra,<a id='t174'></a> produces a more permanent
stimulus than what could have happened from a soluble salt: (<em>Form.
62</em>) thus again the <em>Sulphuret of Antimony</em>, and some other preparations of
that metal, of slow solubility, establish a more permanent influence than
<em>Tartarized Antimony</em>, and may be preferable to it in cases where immediate
and active evacuations are not required.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of remedies composed of vegetable tonics, the useful application of
this principle is also apparent. Thus the addition of <em>alkalies</em>, or <em>lime-water</em>,
to the infusions of <em>Gentian</em>, &amp;c. or to the decoctions of <em>Bark</em>, by rendering
their extractive and resinous principles more soluble, increase their elegance,
and exalt their virtues, (<em>Form. 39, 41</em>,) although this law admits of
an important exception to be hereafter explained. A knowledge of this
principle likewise offers many useful hints connected with the successful
exhibition of active remedies; it points out the medicines which require
dilution in order to promote their operation, and those whose too speedy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>and violent effects may be retarded and checked by an abstinence from all
potation. Thus, in the exhibition of <em>Diuretics</em> likely to become cathartic
or diaphoretic, no liquid should be given for at least an hour after their administration;
the same caution applies with respect to the <em>Compound Powder
of Ipecacuan</em>, which has a strong tendency to excite vomiting. When
the remedy has passed out of the stomach, then the ingestion of fluids
may, and ought to be encouraged.</p>

<p class='c007'>To Sir Francis Milman the profession is highly indebted for hints concerning
the importance of accompanying the exhibition of <em>Diuretics</em> with
plentiful dilution,<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c015'><sup>[269]</sup></a> the arguments he adduces elucidate in a very satisfactory
manner the view which has been just taken of the <span class='sc'>Influence of Solubility</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The influence of solubility<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c015'><sup>[270]</sup></a> in increasing the virulence of a poisonous
substance, has already been illustrated very fully (<em>page 135</em>,) and it
has also been shewn under what circumstance it may be admissible.
When these active substances are administered as remedies, in small
doses, the precept respecting their solubility is even more important,
for in such cases the smallness of the quantity places their operation
more immediately under the control of various incidental agents; <em>destroy</em>
the solubility of a medicine, and you will probably divest it of those properties
which render it useful. <em>Nitrate of Silver</em>, by coming in contact
with a <em>Muriatic Salt</em>, is rendered quite inert, and may be discovered unaltered
in the fæces of persons to whom it has been administered. See <em>Argenti
Nitras</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the article <em>Plumbi Acetas</em> the practitioner will also find that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>conjunction of this substance with any sulphuric salt, at once deprives it
of its valuable properties as a remedy in <em>Hæmopthysis</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some practitioners, whose opinions I always receive with respect, have
considered these views respecting the influence of solubility as savouring
too much of the refinement of theory, and instances have been suggested
which would appear to invalidate their pretensions; upon examination,
however, it will be found that such exceptions are but apparent, and depend
upon the solvent action of the gastric fluid. Thus the <em>Protoxide of
Iron</em> would appear to be soluble in the fluids of the stomach, and is consequently
an active medicine, whereas the <em>Peroxide</em> of the same metal, being
insoluble under such circumstances, requires to be combined with an acid,
as in the <em>Tinctura Ferri Muriatis</em>, to render it efficacious. The same remark
will probably apply to the oxides of antimony.</p>

<p class='c007'>I shall conclude this section upon the influence of Solubility, by the relation
of an anecdote which may tend to confirm the justness of the views
I have offered, more satisfactorily perhaps than any additional arguments
derived from a scientific examination of chemical and medicinal facts; in
as much as it presents us with a practice, the utility of which has been
discovered by unassisted experience, and must consequently be independent
of theory. The American Indians, whenever they undertake a long
journey, and are likely to be destitute of provisions, employ Tobacco for
the purpose of counteracting the uneasy sensations of hunger, and in its
preparation for such a purpose they adopt an expedient for modifying its
powers, and protracting its effects, which affords an instructive illustration
of the influence of solubility; it consists in combining the juice of Tobacco,
with the pulverized shells of snails, cockles, and oysters;<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c015'><sup>[271]</sup></a> the mass is
dried, and formed into pills, of a convenient size to be held between the

<p class='c018'>After the views which have been submitted in the progress of the present
inquiry, it is evident, that the <em>form</em> in which a remedy is administered
may exert some influence upon its medicinal effects; for additional proofs
of this fact, and for more particular directions, see <em>Decocta</em>, <em>Infusa</em>, <em>Tincturæ</em>,

efficacious form, <em>a vehicle should always be selected, whose effects will be likely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>to correspond with the intention of the other ingredients</em>. This precept may be
exemplified by a reference to <em>Form. 80, 134</em>, and others, the <em>key-letters</em> of
which announce the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> of their respective <em>vehicles</em>.</p>

<h5 class='c044'>B. <em>By which its aspect or flavour is rendered more agreeable.</em></h5>

<p class='c018'>It should ever be the object of the practitioner to accommodate, as far
as he is able, the form and flavour of his medicines to the taste and caprice
of his patient, provided always that he does not compromise their efficacy,
and which often appears to be nearly connected with those sensible qualities
which render them disgusting and objectionable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some medicines are more grateful to the stomach, as well as more efficacious
in their operation, when exhibited in the state of effervescence.
To effect this we have only to introduce an alkaline carbonate into the
formula, and to direct a portion of some vegetable acid to be added just
before it is swallowed. We must, however, take care that the ingredients
are of a nature not likely to be decomposed by the alkali, in the first instance,
or by the neutral salt, which is formed, in the second. See <em>Form.
27, 82, 86</em>.</p>

<h5 class='c044'>C. <em>By which it is</em> <span class='fss'>PRESERVED</span> <em>from the spontaneous decomposition to which it is liable.</em></h5>

<p class='c018'>It is sometimes adviseable to add an ingredient for the purpose of preventing
the sudden decomposition of a medicine; thus is the <em>Compound
Tincture of Cardamoms</em> added to the <em>Compound Decoction of Aloes</em>, in order
that the latter may be preserved a longer period without change. The
addition of sugar will prevent ointments from becoming rancid. Vegetable
infusions, that are susceptible of mouldiness, are best preserved from
such deterioration by some aromatic addition. For the knowledge of this
fact we are indebted to Dr. Mac Culloch, who in a very interesting paper,
lately published in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c015'><sup>[273]</sup></a> has observed,
that perfumes, such as <em>Essential Oils</em>, &amp;c. will prevent the production and
growth of those minute cryptogamous vegetables, upon which the phenomenon
of mouldiness depends.<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c015'><sup>[274]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Such are the objects which are to be attained by combining several
substances in one <em>Formula</em>, and such the laws by which these compositions
are to be regulated; but unless a physician can satisfactorily trace the
operation of each element in his prescription to the accomplishment of one
or more of the objects which I have enumerated, <span class='fss'>SIMPLICITY</span> should be regarded
by him as the greatest desideratum. I was once told by a practitioner
in the country that the quantity, or rather complexity of the medicines
which he gave his patients, for there never was any deficiency in
the former, was always increased in a ratio with the obscurity of their
cases; “if,” said he, “I fire a great profusion of shot, it is very extraordinary
if some do not hit the mark.” Sir Gilbert Blane<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c015'><sup>[275]</sup></a> has given us a similar
anecdote; “a practitioner being asked by his patient why he put so many
ingredients into his prescription, is said to have answered more facetiously
than philosophically, <em>in order that the disease may take which it likes best</em>.”
A patient in the hands of such a practitioner has not a much better chance
than the Chinese Mandarin who, upon being attacked with any disorder,
calls in twelve or more physicians, and swallows in one mixture all the
potions which each separately prescribes!</p>

<p class='c007'>Let not the young practitioner however be so deceived; he should remember
that unless he be well acquainted with the mutual actions which
bodies exert upon each other, and upon the living system, it may be laid
down as an axiom, that <em>in proportion as he complicates a medicine, he does but
multiply the chances of its failure</em>. <span class='sc'>Superflua nunquam non nocent</span>:
let him cherish this maxim in his remembrance, and in forming compounds,
always discard from them every element which has not its mode
of action clearly defined, and as thoroughly understood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The perfection of a Medicinal Prescription may be defined by three
words; it should be <span class='sc'>Precise</span> (in its <em>directions</em>,) <span class='sc'>Concise</span> (in its <em>construction</em>,)
<span class='sc'>Decisive</span> (in its <em>operation</em>.) It should carry upon its very face an
air of energy and decision, and speak intelligibly the indications which it
is to fulfil. It may be laid down as a position which is not in much danger
of being controverted, that <em>where the intention of a medicinal compound
is obscure, its operation will be imbecile</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Medicinal Formula has been divided into four constituent parts, a division
which will be found to admit of useful application to practice, in
as much as it was evidently suggested with a view of accomplishing the
more prominent objects which have been related in the preceding pages;
or, in the language of Asclepiades, of enabling the <span class='sc'>Basis</span> to operate
“<span class='sc'>Cito</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Tuto</span>,” et “<span class='sc'>Jucunde</span>.” Quickly, Safely, and Pleasantly—thus</p>

<p class='c047'>I. <span class='sc'>The Basis</span>, or Principal Medicine.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>(<em>curare.</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c047'>II. <span class='sc'>The Adjuvans</span>; that which assists and promotes its operation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>(“<em>Cito.</em>”)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c047'>III. <span class='sc'>The Corrigens</span>; that which corrects its operation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>(“<em>Tuto.</em>”)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c047'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>IV. <span class='sc'>The Constituens</span>; that which imparts an agreeable form.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>(“<em>Jucunde.</em>”)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These elements however are not all necessarily present in every scientific
formula, for many medicines do not require any addition to promote
their operation, and the mild and tractable nature of others renders the addition
of any corrective unnecessary; whilst many again are in themselves
sufficiently manageable, and do not therefore require the <em>intermede</em>
of any <em>vehicle</em> or <em>constituent</em>. It also frequently occurs that one element
is capable of fulfilling two or more of the objects required; the <span class='sc'>Adjuvans</span>
for instance, may at the same time act as the <span class='sc'>Corrigens</span>, or <span class='sc'>Constituens</span>;
thus the addition of <em>Soap</em> to <em>Aloes</em>, or <em>Extract of Jalap</em>, mitigates
their acrimony, and at the same time quickens their operation (80.) So
again <em>Neutral Salts</em> both quicken and correct the griping which attends
the operation of resinous purgatives. The disposition of the key letters
placed opposite to the elements of the following <em>Formulæ</em>, will furnish the
practitioner with a farther elucidation of these principles, viz. 70, 71, 76,
77, 101, 102, 105, 135, &amp;c. This coincidence, if possible, should be always
attained, for it simplifies the formula, and by decreasing the bulk of
the remedy, renders it less nauseous and more elegant.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c015'><sup>[276]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This division also affords the best general rule for placing the ingredients
of a formula in proper order, for the order should correspond with
that of the arrangement; and those elements intended to act in unity
should be marshalled together. The chemical and mechanical nature
however of a medicinal substance will occasionally offer exceptions to
any general rule; thus the volatile ingredients should be those last added,
and the constituent or <em>vehicle</em> should be placed next the particular element
to which it is intended to impart convenience or efficacy of form, or a capability
of mixing with the other ingredients, as may be seen in Formulæ
69, 71, 127, 136, &amp;c. This consideration induced the Committee, appointed
to revise the late Pharmacopœia, to alter the order of the ingredients
in the “<em>Mistura Ferri composita</em>,” and to place the “<em>Spiritus Myristicæ</em>”
next in succession to the “<em>Potassæ Sub-carbonas</em>” and <em>Myrrh</em>.
If any substance require decoction or infusion, a question then arises, determinable
only by a knowledge of its chemical composition, whether the
remaining ingredients should be added previous to, during, or subsequent
to, that operation; <em>Formula 40</em>, which is recommended by Pringle as a
remedy for Typhus fever, may serve to exemplify this principle. The
preparation of the ingredients is resolved into three distinct stages, and it
is easy to discover that by any other arrangement their several virtues
could not be fully obtained, and secured from change. The <em>Cinchona</em>, for
instance, yields its full powers only by decoction, a process which would
necessarily impair those of <em>Serpentaria</em>, connected as they are with an essential
oil; whilst the addition of the acid at any other stage of the process
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>than that directed, would produce decompositions in the vegetable
substances; and it is evident that were the <em>Spirit of Cinnamon</em> added previously,
it would be entirely lost by vaporization. So in making the
<em>Compound Decoction of Sarsaparilla</em>, the <em>Sassafras</em> should be added after
the other ingredients have undergone boiling. The Decoctions of <em>Lichen
Islandicus</em> and <em>Sarsaparilla</em> constitute a popular remedy on the Continent,
in certain forms of Phthisis; now it is evident that as the former plant
loses its virtues by long coction, and the latter requires a protracted ebullition
for the extraction of its virtues, they ought not to be included under
the same general directions; each decoction should be separately performed,
and the results subsequently mixed.</p>

<h5 class='c044'><span class='sc'>Compound Medicines</span> have been divided into two Classes, <em>viz</em>.</h5>

<h6 class='c044'>I. <span class='sc'>Officinal Preparations</span>,</h6>

<p class='c018'>which are those ordered in the Pharmacopœias, and kept ready prepared
in the shops. No uniform class of medicines however can answer the indications
of every case, and hence the necessity of</p>

<h6 class='c044'>II. <span class='sc'>Magistral or Extemporaneous Formulæ</span>.</h6>

<p class='c018'>These are constructed by the practitioner at the moment, and may be
either arrangements altogether new, or officinal preparations with additions,
or modifications. Too much importance cannot be assigned to the
Art which thus enables the physician to adopt and graduate a powerful
remedy to each particular case by a prompt and accurate prescription;
without this knowledge, the practitioner of the nineteenth century, with
all the collateral aid of modern science, will be as helpless in the chamber
of sickness as the physicians of ancient Egypt, who were obliged by the
laws to follow with servile exactness the unvarying mandates of their medical
code. <em>Extemporaneous</em> are also preferable to <em>Officinal Formulæ</em>, whenever
the powers of the compound are less liable to deterioration from being
long kept; for examples, see <em>Mistura Ferri composita</em>; <em>Infusum Sennæ</em>;
<em>Liquor Hydrargyri Oxymuriatis</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<h5 class='c044'><span class='sc'>The Chemical and Pharmaceutical Errors, which may be committed in the composition of Extemporaneous Formulæ, are referable to the following Sources</span>.</h5>

<h6 class='c044'>1.—<em>Substances are added together which are incapable of mixing, or, of forming Compounds of uniform and suitable consistence.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>This may be termed an error in the <em>Mechanism</em> of the Prescription, and
has been generally regarded as being more inconvenient than dangerous,
more fatal to the credit of the Prescriber than to the case of the Patient:
the observations however which are offered in this work, especially under
the article <em>Pilulæ</em>, must satisfy the practitioner that this error is more mischievous
in its effects than has been usually supposed; it is so palpable
and self-evident in its nature, that it will be unnecessary to illustrate it by
more than one or two examples. <em>Calomel</em>, for instance, has been ordered
in an aqueous vehicle, and certain <em>resinous tinctures</em> have been directed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>in draughts, without the necessary intervention of mucilage; so again,
an intermixture of substances has been formerly ordered in powder that
possess the perverse property of becoming liquid by triture (see <em>Pulveres</em>),
and bodies have been prescribed in the form of pills, whose consistence<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c015'><sup>[277]</sup></a>
renders it impossible that they should preserve the globular form;
or else they have been so hard and insoluble, that they might be fired
through a deal board.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c015'><sup>[278]</sup></a> In the London Pharmacopœia of 1809, an error
of this kind unfortunately passed without correction with regard to the
Formula for preparing the <em>Syrup of Senna</em>.</p>

<h6 class='c044'>II.—<em>Substances are added together which mutually decompose each other, whence their original virtues are changed, or destroyed.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>This is a more serious, but not a less frequent source of error; it has
been already shewn in this Analysis (IV. B) that the judicious and scientific
application of chemical science has furnished new and endless resources
to the physician, by exalting the efficacy and correcting the acrimony
of established remedies, or by combining inert substances so as to
create new and powerful medicines. With equal truth and confidence it
may be asserted, that the abuse of these means not only destroys the virtues
of the most valuable articles in the <em>Materia Medica</em>, but that the mildest
remedy may be thus converted into an instrument of torture, and even
of death. In a lecture delivered at Apothecaries’ Hall, Mr. Brande stated
that he had seen a prescription in which the <em>blue</em>, or mercurial pill, was ordered
in conjunction with nitric acid, and that the patient was brought to
“death’s door” from the formation of <em>nitrate of mercury</em> in his stomach! I
have myself lately seen a <em>Recipe</em>, professing to afford a preparation similar
to the “<em>Black Drop</em>,” and which directed a mixture of a <em>Tincture of Opium</em>,
made with rectified spirit, with <em>Nitric Acid</em>; in this case, it may be very
safely inferred that the author was not only ignorant of the chemical habitudes
of these bodies, but that he never performed the experiment in question,
or he would have learnt from dire experience, that in consequence of
the rapid evolution of <em>nitric ether</em>, the contents of the phial will explode
with violence, to the imminent hazard of the operator’s eye-sight. During
the course of my professional practice I have witnessed more than an ordinary
share of consumptive cases, and I can confidently state that in the
treatment of Hæmopthysis, the styptic properties of <em>Acetate of lead</em> are entirely
invalidated by combination with <em>Alum</em>,<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c015'><sup>[279]</sup></a> or by its exhibition being
accompanied with that of the acidulated <em>infusion of roses</em>, or with small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>doses of <em>sulphate of magnesia</em>; and yet, I would ask, whether this practice is
not usual and general? The practitioner however cannot be too often reminded
that he is not to reject a remedy whose value has been ascertained
by experience, merely because it appears to be unchemical: the popular
and certainly useful pill, consisting of calomel, rhubarb and soap, may be
adduced as an example of this kind. Of the <em>Mistura Ferri Composita</em>, I
will only say that it is a most valuable combination; and whether it be the
product of accident, or the result of philosophical induction, it equally deserves
a distinguished place in our list of tonic remedies: but it cannot be
denied that many of our esteemed arrangements, which are in apparent
contradiction to all the laws of composition, owe their efficacy to the operation
of affinities altogether blind and fortuitous.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been observed that the practice of combining certain vegetable
tonics with lime-water, although very common, is in cases where we are
desirous to obtain their <em>astringent</em> effects, of very doubtful propriety; for
the fact is, that <em>Tannin</em> forms with the alkalies and alkaline earths, compounds
that are not soluble in water,<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c015'><sup>[280]</sup></a> and which are therefore probably
inefficacious. It may perhaps be said that such an argument cannot avail,
because if the astringent matter be even introduced into the stomach in
its purest form, it will immediately form an insoluble compound on its contact
with <em>gelatine</em>.<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c015'><sup>[281]</sup></a> We know so little of the laws of <em>gastric chemistry</em>,
that it is difficult to learn what changes take place in the animal laboratory;
but it would seem probable that the powers of the stomach rather
consist in decomposing the ingesta into simple forms, than in complicating
them by favoring new combinations; besides which, if such a compound
were formed, it would be subsequently decomposed <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in transitu</span></i>; for the experiments
of Sir H. Davy shew that vegetable astringent matter passes
through the body unchanged. (<em>page 82.</em>)</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible to furnish any general rule that may enable the practitioner
to avoid mixing together substances which are incompatible with
each other; a knowledge of their chemical habitudes must in every case
direct him, and these are enumerated in the second part of this work, under
the history of each medicinal substance. The physician however
will find it useful to retain in his remembrance the simple and beautiful
law which has been so ably developed by the eminent author of the
“<span class='sc'>Statique Chimique</span>,” that <em>whenever two salts in a state of solution are
brought together, which contain, within themselves, elements capable of producing
a soluble and insoluble salt, a decomposition must necessarily arise</em>;<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c015'><sup>[282]</sup></a> he
illustrates this law by the example of <em>Nitrate of Silver</em> and <em>Muriate of
Potass</em>, whose elements are capable of forming within themselves a soluble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>salt, <em>Nitrate of Potass</em>, and an insoluble salt, <em>Muriate of Silver</em>. It deserves
also to be remembered, that a table of chemical affinity will not
upon all occasions prove to the medical practitioner an unerring pilot; in
those cases for instance, where a <em>super or sub Salt is readily formed, a substance
less weakly attracted by another than a third, will sometimes precipitate this
third from its combination with the second</em>, thus in the production of <em>Nitric
acid</em>, we decompose the <em>Nitrate of Potass</em> by virtue of the superior affinity
of the <em>Sulphuric acid</em> for its base, the nitric acid is accordingly disengaged,
and a <em>Sulphate of Potass</em> remains in the retort; now, paradoxical as it
may appear, if nitric acid be poured upon the <em>Sulphate of Potass</em>, a quantity
of nitre will be reproduced, in consequence of the saturation of a portion
of the base, in such a proportion as to enable the remaining atoms to
form a <em>Bi-Sulphate of Potass</em>. In the same manner the <em>Tartrate of Potass</em>
(Soluble Tartar) is, contrary to the usual affinities, decomposed by all sub-acid
vegetables, which neutralize a portion of the base, and convert the
salt into the <em>Bi-tartrate of Potass</em> (<em>Cream of Tartar</em>). The same effect is
even produced by <em>Carbonic acid</em>.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c015'><sup>[283]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There are besides certain cases wherein <em>Triple Salts</em> are produced, which
afford apparent exceptions to the usual affinities of the bodies involved in
the combination; we have a very good illustration of this truth in the decomposition
of the <em>Liquor Ammoniæ Acetatis</em> by <em>Magnesia</em>; if the practitioner
refers to a table of affinities, he will perceive that <em>Acetic acid</em> has a
greater attraction for <em>Ammonia</em> than for <em>Magnesia</em>; but if upon this assurance
he were to administer these bodies together, he, or his patient, would
soon discover that ammonia is developed with considerable pungency;
now in this case the <em>Magnesia</em> forms a <em>triple Acetate</em> with one part of the
ammonia, and consequently sets the remainder at liberty.</p>

<p class='c007'>A popular error exists with respect to the subject of chemical incompatibility,
against which it may be here advisable to caution the inexperienced
prescriber, viz. that <em>no important change is produced, on the admixture of
solutions, unless precipitation is occasioned</em>. This however occurs only when
the new compound produced is insoluble; thus <em>Sulphuric acid</em> may be added
to <em>Lime water</em>, by which a <em>Sulphate of Lime</em> is formed, but as its proportion
is not too large for the water to dissolve, no precipitate occurs; so
again, a solution of <em>Nitrate of Silver</em> is not apparently disturbed by the
addition of <em>Ammonia</em>, because the resulting <em>Ammoniuret</em> is a soluble compound.
We should, nevertheless, commit a great error in supposing that,
for such a reason, these bodies were not <em>incompatible</em>. On the other hand,
the medicinal powers of a solution are not necessarily destroyed by the
occurrence of a precipitate, although such a result should always be regarded
with suspicion.</p>

<h6 class='c044'>III.—<em>The Methods directed for the preparation of the Ingredients are either inadequate to the accomplishment of the object, or they change and destroy the efficacy of the Substances.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>The observations already offered upon <em>Formula 40</em>, will sufficiently explain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the nature of the various errors comprehended under this head: so,
again, if the virtues of a plant reside in <em>essential oils</em>, which are easily volatilized,
or in <em>extractive matter</em>, which readily becomes oxidized, <span class='sc'>Decoction</span>
must necessarily destroy its efficacy; a striking example of this fact is
presented us in the history of the <em>Laurel</em> and <em>Bitter Almond:</em> the poisonous
influence of the essential oil and distilled water of these vegetable substances
is well known, but their watery extracts are perfectly innocuous.
A still more familiar example is to be found in the onion, or in garlic,
which by simple coction is deprived of all its acrimonious qualities. On
the other hand, an error equally injurious would be committed, by directing
a simple infusion of a vegetable, whose medicinal properties depended
upon resino-mucilaginous principles. Orfila found that an extract of Hemlock,
prepared by boiling the dried powder in water and evaporating the
decoction, was entirely destitute of activity. See <em>Decocta</em>, <em>Infusa</em>, <em>Extracta</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>An instance of the baneful effects which may arise from an erroneous
method of preparation happened some time ago to fall under my immediate
notice and care; it was in preparing an infusion of the root of the
<em>Veratrum</em> with <em>Opium</em>, as directed by Mr. James Moore, when the dispenser
ignorantly substituted a spirituous for a vinous menstruum.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very common error may be here noticed, which is that of prescribing
a substance in such a form, as not to be acted upon with any effect by the
solvent; as an example it may be stated, that in preparing an infusion of
<em>Juniper Berries</em>, unless pains be taken by strong contusion to break the
seed, it will contain but little power as a medicine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The unbruised seeds of Mustard were commended by Dr. Mead,<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c015'><sup>[284]</sup></a> in
Ascites, and by Bergius, in Intermittents; Dr. Cullen, however, has very
properly observed that the seeds given in the above manner are never
broken down or dissolved in the stomach, but pass away entire by stool,
and cannot therefore occasion any beneficial result.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is unnecessary to multiply examples in proof of the numerous errors
into which a physician must unavoidably fall, who presumes to compose
prescriptions without a knowledge of the chemical habitudes of the different
substances which he combines. The file of every apothecary
would furnish a volume of instances, where the ingredients of the prescription
are fighting together in the dark, or at least are so adverse to
each other, as to constitute a most incongruous and chaotic mass.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Doses of Medicinal Substances</span> are specific with respect to
each, and can therefore be only learnt from experience; the young and
eager practitioner, however, is too often betrayed into the error of supposing
that the powers of a remedy always increase in an equal ratio with its
dose, whereas <span class='sc'>The dose alone very often determines its specific
action</span>. “<em>Medicines</em>,” says Linnæus, “<em>differ from poisons, not in their nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>but in their dose</em>,” which is but a paraphrase of the well known aphorism
of Pliny, “<em>Ubi virus, ibi virtus</em>.”<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c015'><sup>[285]</sup></a>—So that food, remedies, and poisons,
may be said to branch into each other by indefinable gradations;—Five
grains of <em>Camphor</em> act as a mild sedative and slight diaphoretic, but
twenty grains induce nausea, and act as a stimulant; so again, <em>Opium</em>, in
too large doses, instead of promoting, prevents sleep, and rather stimulates
the bowels than acts as a narcotic. Two ounces of any neutral salt
are apt to be emetic, one ounce even of <em>Alum</em> to be cathartic, and two
drachms to be refrigerant; in like manner the preparations of <em>Antimony</em>
either vomit, purge, or sweat, according to the quantity exhibited.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would it not appear that <em>powerful doses rather produce a local than a general
effect</em>? Experience seems to prove in this respect, that the effect of
an internal application is similar to that of an external impression; if violent,
it affects the part only to which it is applied, as pinching does that of
the skin, whereas titillation, which may be said to differ only from the
former in degree, acts upon the whole system, and occasions itching and
laughter, and if long continued, weakness, sickness, vomiting, and convulsions;
in like manner <em>Digitalis</em>, if given in large doses, acts immediately
upon the stomach or bowels, becoming emetic and cathartic, but in smaller
proportions it produces a <span class='sc'>General</span> effect, increasing all the excretions,
especially that of urine; so, again, large doses of the <em>Mercurial Pill</em> act
upon the bowels, and are eliminated from the body, whereas the same remedy
in small doses affects the system generally, and excites a universal
influence. I am well satisfied that the regulation of the dose of a medicine
is even more important than it is usually supposed to be. <em>Substances
perfectly inert and useless in one dose may prove in another active and valuable.</em>
Hence may be explained the great efficacy of many mineral waters,
whilst the ingredients which impart activity to them are found comparatively
inert, when they become the elements of an artificial combination;
and hence probably the failure of many <em>alterative</em> medicines, when no
other rational cause can be assigned for it. We need not seek far for an
example of the very different and opposite effects which the same substance
can produce in different doses; the operation of <em>Common Salt</em> is familiar
to us all; Sir John Pringle has shewn that in quantities such as we
usually take with our food, its action is highly septic, softening and resolving
all meat to which it is applied, whereas in large quantities it usually
preserves such substances from putrefaction, and therefore, when so taken,
instead of promoting, destroys digestion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>It is moreover probable that medicinal, like nutritive substances, are
more readily absorbed into the circulating system when presented in small
quantities, than when applied in more considerable proportions. It is upon
this principle that a large quantity of food, taken seldom, does not fatten
so much as smaller quantities at shorter intervals, as is exemplified in the
universal good condition of cooks and their attendants. It is not pressing
the principle of analogy too far to suppose that the action of <em>alteratives</em>,
which require to be absorbed, may be more effectually answered by similar
management; that is, <em>by exhibiting small doses at short intervals</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The operation of medicines is influenced by certain general circumstances,
which should be also kept in mind when we apportion their dose;
e.g. <span class='sc'>Age</span>—<span class='sc'>Sex</span>—<span class='sc'>Temperament</span>—<span class='sc'>Strength of the Patient</span>—<span class='sc'>Habit</span>—<span class='sc'>Diet</span>—<span class='sc'>Profession</span>—<span class='sc'>Climate</span>—<span class='sc'>Duration
of the Disease</span>—<span class='sc'>State
of the Stomach</span>—<span class='sc'>Idiosyncrasy</span>—and <span class='sc'>The variable Activity
of the Medicinal Substance</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Women generally require smaller doses than men. Habit, or the protracted
use of a medicine, generally diminishes its power, although certain
cathartics appear to offer an exception, for when long continued, their activity
is proportionally increased, as is well known to every person who is
familiar with the operation of the Cheltenham waters. Dr. Lamb has
also stated with regard to the operation of Lead, “that the constitution, so
far from being reconciled to it by habit, is rendered more and more sensible
to its irritation by continuance.” Emetics also frequently become more
powerful by repetition; Cullen informs us that he knew a person so accustomed
to excite vomiting in himself that the one twentieth part of a
grain of tartarized antimony was sufficient to excite a convulsive action
of the stomach; in some cases such an effect may perhaps be referred to
the operation of the mind; for after the frequent use of an emetic, the
mere sight of it, or even conversation relative to it, has been found sufficient
to excite nausea.</p>

<p class='c007'>In apportioning the dose of a very active medicine, it is of the greatest
moment to determine the relative degrees of power between the system
and the remedy, and to know to what extent the latter is likely to be carried,
consonantly with the powers of life to resist it; thus, after a patient
has been exhausted by protracted and severe suffering and watching, a
dose, different to one at the commencement of the disease is requisite.
The importance of this precept is impressed upon my mind from having
witnessed, in the course of my practice, several instances of the mischief
which has arisen from a want of attention to it; that disease materially
influences the condition of the body, and its susceptibility to remedial impressions,
has been already demonstrated. Emetics act very readily in
febrile affections, while in those of the Neuroses<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c015'><sup>[286]</sup></a> they produce their
effects with difficulty.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the application of external remedies to diseased parts, it especially
behoves the Surgeon to take into consideration the degree of vitality possessed
by such parts, and to graduate their strength accordingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Henry Earle<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c015'><sup>[287]</sup></a> has published a very interesting case in illustration
of this principle. The arm of a person became paralytic, in consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>of an injury of the axillary plexus of nerves from a fracture of the collar
bone; upon keeping the limb for nearly half an hour in a tub of warm
grains, ‘<em>which were previously ascertained by the other hand not to be too hot</em>,’
the whole hand became blistered in a most alarming manner, and sloughs
formed at the extremities of the fingers, and underneath the nails; a considerable
degree of inflammation subsequently spread in the course of the
absorbents, and matter formed in the axilla, which was soon absorbed, and
the inflammation assuaged. Whence it follows, that a limb deprived of
its usual supply of nervous energy cannot sustain, without injury, an elevation
of temperature which would not be in the least prejudicial to a
healthy member. Mr. Earle supports this conclusion by the relation of
another case, in which the ulnar nerve had been divided, for the cure of a
painful affection of the arm; the consequence of which operation was,
that the patient was incapable of washing in water at a temperature that
was quite harmless to every duly vitalized part, without suffering from vesication
and sloughs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before we quit the subject of <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, it may be necessary to observe,
that there are many remedies that do not act with greater violence in a
large dose than in one comparatively small; <em>Ipecacuan</em>, for instance, is
more certain in its operation, but not more violent, when given in a large
quantity; the same may be said of <em>Aloes</em>, and several other medicines.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Variable Activity of a Medicine</span> should also be appreciated,
and perhaps the practitioner would act cautiously if he were to reduce
the dose, should it be a very considerable one, whenever a fresh parcel of
the medicine is commenced, especially of the powders of active vegetables
liable to deterioration from being kept, as those of <em>Digitalis</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Time of the Day</span> at which remedies should be administered deserves
likewise some attention. <em>Evacuating Medicines</em> ought to be exhibited
late at night or early in the morning. It would seem that during
sleep the bowels are not so irritable, and consequently not so easily acted
upon, which allows time for the full solution of the substance; the same
observation applies to <em>Alterative</em> and other medicines which are liable to
suffer from a vexatious irritability of the bowels; it is on this account
eligible to exhibit <em>Guaiacum</em>, <em>Pilulæ Hydrargyri</em>, &amp;c. when they are not intended
to purge, at bed time. On the other hand, where the effects of a
remedy are likely to be lost by perspiration, as is the case with <em>Diuretics</em>,
many of which are by external heat changed into <em>Diaphoretics</em>, it may
become a question with the judicious practitioner whether he cannot select
some more favourable period for their exhibition.</p>

<p class='c007'>In fevers it is of importance to consult in all respects the quiet and comfort
of the patient; Dr. Hamilton therefore, in his valuable work on Purgatives,
very judiciously observes that, on this account, the exhibition of
purgative medicines should be so timed, that their effects may be expected
during the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some cases the time of administering a remedy must be regulated
by the stage of the disease; thus, in fevers, a dose of opium will either
increase the heat of the body, augment thirst and restlessness, or occasion
tranquillity and sleep, according to the temperature of the body at the
time of its administration; for this reason Dr. Currie advises us not to
give the evening dose of Opium in Typhoid fevers, till very late, or about
one or two o’clock in the morning, when the heat is subsiding, and moisture
is coming on. Emetics administered for the cure of the slighter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>cases of Pyrexia should be given in the evening, as their operation leaves
a tendency to sleep and diaphoresis, which it is useful to promote. Remedies
that require to be <em>absorbed</em> will probably be more efficient in the
morning after sleep; the old custom of giving medicines on a morning
<em>fasting</em>, is not quite so absurd as some modern practitioners have been led
to suppose. Diaphoretics should be always given after the digestive process
is ended, for during the performance of this function the emunctories
of the skin are less disposed to action.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Intervals between each Dose</span> must be regulated by the nature
of the remedy and that of the objects which it is intended to fulfil,
and whether it be desirable or not that the latter dose should support the
effects of the preceding one, or whether there be any fear of a reaction or
collapse taking place after the effect of one dose has subsided, unless immediately
repeated; thus the effects of diffusible stimulants, such as ammonia
and æther, are very evanescent, they should therefore be repeated
at short intervals; the same may be said of <em>Diaphoretics</em>, especially the
lenient ones; we ought not to allow the period between the doses to be so
remote as to occasion any striking abatement in the impression: so Opium,
where its primary and stimulant operation is required, as in diseases of
debility, such as fevers of the typhoid type, should be given in small doses
at short intervals, so that it may enkindle and sustain a uniform and regular
state of excitement: but where the object is to mitigate pain, allay
irritation, and produce sleep, it ought to be exhibited in full doses, at distant
intervals. There is a caution also which it is very necessary to impress
upon the practitioner, respecting the power which some medicines
possess of <em>accumulating</em><a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c015'><sup>[288]</sup></a> in the system; this is notorious with regard to
Lead and Mercury, and probably with the preparations of Arsenic, and
some other metallic compounds. Dr. Withering has observed that the repetition
of small doses of <em>Digitalis</em>, at short intervals, till it produces a
sensible effect, is an unsafe practice, since a dangerous accumulation will
frequently take place before any signals of forbearance present themselves.
I have already alluded to the possibility of mercurial accumulation, and
its developement at a remote period.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Constitutional Peculiarities</span>, or <span class='sc'>Idiosyncrasies</span>, will sometimes
render the operation of the mildest medicine poisonous, “<em>Virum novi</em>,” says
Gaubius, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui cum fatuum lapidum cancrorum pulvisculum ingessit, vix mitius
afficitur quam alii ab Arsenico</span></i>.” I have seen a general Erysipelas follow
the application of a blister, and tormina of the bowels, no less severe than
those produced by the ingestion of <em>Arsenic</em>, attend the operation of purgatives
composed of <em>Senna</em>! In some constitutions Antimony has been
known to produce a ptyalism; Dr. James assured Sir George Baker that
he knew six instances of it, although the patients thus affected had neither
their teeth loosened, nor their breath made offensive. The peculiar
susceptibility of certain individuals to the effects of particular plants is also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>very singular: Murray relates that unpleasant symptoms have been experienced
by merely keeping <em>Aconite</em> for some time in the hand, or on the
bosom. I am acquainted with two persons in whom the odour of Ipecacuan
always produces a most distressing dyspnæa; Mr. Chevalier informs
us, that he once knew a lady who could not take <em>Powdered</em> Rhubarb,
without an erysipelatous efflorescence<a id='t189'></a> almost immediately shewing itself on
the skin, and yet she could take it in the form of <em>Infusion</em> with perfect impunity.
There are some idiosyncrasies so singular and incredible, that
nothing but unimpeachable testimony could sanction our belief in their
existence. Schenkius relates a case in which the general law of astringents
and cathartics was always reversed. Donatus tells us of a boy
whose jaws swelled, whose face broke out in spots, and whose lips frothed,
whenever he eat an egg.</p>

<p class='c007'>The late Pope Pius VII. had such an antipathy to musk, that on one
occasion of presentation, an individual of the company having been scented
with that perfume, his holiness was obliged to dismiss the party almost
immediately.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c015'><sup>[289]</sup></a> Education, and early habits certainly establish very extraordinary
peculiarities in different countries with respect to various objects
of diet and luxury: what shall we say of the refinement of the Ancients
who regarded the flavour of the Citron with disgust, while the odour
of putrid fish was deemed by them so exquisite, that they carried it about
in caskets of onyx as a favourite perfume! Custom makes the Greenlander
relish his train oil; and Dr. Heberden tells us, that there is a town
in North America, where the spring-water is brackish, and that, when the
inhabitants visit any other province, they choose to put salt into their tea
or punch, in order, as they say, “<em>to make it taste as it should do</em>.”<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c015'><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Climate.</span> Several observations have already been offered upon the
influence of Climate in affecting the activity of our remedies.<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c015'><sup>[291]</sup></a> With regard
to its relations to <em>Dose</em>, I have only one remark to make to the English
practitioner, and that by the way of caution, that he will not allow his
own previous experience in hot climates, or the persuasions of other tropical
practitioners to induce him to administer such doses of Mercury, in England,
as may have been found salutary in India, or in other Colonies of
similar temperature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The popular scheme of Gaubius for graduating the doses of medicine
to different ages, which was published in several of the former editions of
this work, is now omitted, as being less easy of application than the following
simple formula by Dr. Young.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>RULE.</h4>

<p class='c051'><em>For children under twelve years, the doses of most Medicines must be
diminished in the proportion of the Age, to the Age increased by 12.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Every general rule however respecting the doses of medicines will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>have exceptions. Thus children will bear larger doses of <em>Calomel</em> than

in considerable quantities, prove injurious even in small doses to
children.<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c015'><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In concluding this part of the subject, it is proper to impress upon the

    <div><span class='sc'>On the Particular Forms of Remedies, and the general principles upon which their construction and administration are to be regulated.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><em>SOLID FORMS.</em></h3>

<h4 class='c034'>PULVERES. <em>Powders.</em></h4>

<p class='c018'>The form of powder is in many cases the most efficient and eligible
mode in which a medicinal substance can be exhibited, more especially
under the following circumstances.</p>

<h5 class='c034'>1. <em>Simple Powders.</em></h5>

<p class='c018'>1. Whenever a remedy requires the combination of all, or most of its
principles, to ensure its full effects, as <em>Bark</em>, <em>Ipecacuan</em>, <em>Jalap</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Where medicinal bodies are insoluble, and indisposed to undergo
those essential changes, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in transitu</span></i>, which render them operative; for it
must be remembered that by minute division, every particle is presented to
the stomach in a state of activity, being more immediately exposed to the
solvent or decomposing powers of that organ.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Where the mechanical condition of the substance is such as to occasion
irritation<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c015'><sup>[294]</sup></a> of the stomach, as the <em>Sulphuretum Antimonii</em>, or in external
applications to produce an improper effect upon the skin, as <em>Hydrargyri
nitrico-oxydum</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>The degree of fineness to which substances should be reduced by pulverization,
in order to obtain their utmost efficacy, is a very important
question. The impalpable form appears to be extremely injurious to some
bodies, as to <em>cinchona</em>, <em>rhubarb</em>, <em>guaiacum</em>, and to certain aromatics, in consequence,
probably, of an essential part of their substance being dissipated,
or chemically changed by the operation. Fabbroni, for instance, found
by experiment that cinchona yielded a much larger proportion of soluble
extractive, when only coarsely powdered. I think it may be laid down
as a general rule, that <em>extreme pulverization assists the operation of all substances
whose active principles are not easily soluble, and of compound powders
whose ingredients require, for their activity, an intermixture; whilst it certainly
injures, if it does not destroy, the virtues of such as contain as their active constituent,
a volatile principle which is easily dissipated, or extractive matter which
is readily oxidized</em>.</p>

<h5 class='c034'>2. <em>Compound Powders.</em></h5>

<p class='c018'>The disintegration of a substance is much accelerated and extended by
the addition of other materials; hence the pharmaceutical aphorism of
Gaubius, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Celerior atque facilior succedat composita, quam simplex pulverisatio.</span></i>”
Thus several refractory vegetable bodies, as <em>myrrh</em>, <em>gamboge</em>, &amp;c.
are easily reduced by triturating them with sugar or a hard gum;
and some gum resins, as <em>assafœtida</em> or <em>scammony</em>, by the addition of a few
drops of almond oil. Upon the same principle the Pharmacopœia
directs the trituration of aloes with clean white sand, in the process for
preparing <em>Vinum Aloes</em>, to facilitate the pulverization and to prevent the
particles of aloes, when moistened by the liquid, from running together
into masses; some dispensers very judiciously adopt the same mechanical
expedient in making a tincture of myrrh; so again, in ordering a watery
infusion of opium, it will be judicious to advise the previous trituration
of the opium with some hard and insoluble substance, as directed in
the <em>Pulvis Cornu Usti cum Opio</em>, otherwise its particles will adhere with tenacity,
and the water be accordingly unable to exert a solvent operation
upon its substance.<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c015'><sup>[295]</sup></a> It is equally evident that in the construction of compound
medicinal powders, the addition of an inert ingredient, which the
mere chemist might condemn and discard as useless, not unfrequently acts
a very important part in the combination, owing to its effects in dividing
and comminuting the mere active constituents: the <em>sulphate of potass</em> in
Dover’s powder acts merely in dividing and mixing more intimately the
particles of opium and ipecacuan: the <em>phosphate of lime</em> appears to act in
the same mechanical manner in the Antimonial Powder; so again, in the
<em>Pulvis Contrajervæ compositus</em>, the prepared oyster shells may be a necessary
ingredient: in the <em>Pulvis Jalapæ compositus</em> of the Edinburgh College,
the cream of tartar greatly increases the activity of the jalap, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>breaking down its substance and dividing its particles; and Van Swieten
observes that the operation of this resinous purgative is improved by bruising
it with sugar, and adding some aromatic. The old combination of
<em>Pulvis Helvetii</em> consisted of alum and dragon’s blood, and there can be no
doubt but that the effect of this latter ingredient, which has been often ridiculed,
was to retard the solution of alum in the stomach, in consequence
of which the preparation was likely to produce less inconvenience, and
could therefore be administered in larger doses; the Edinburgh college
has substituted gum Kino in their <em>Pulvis Aluminis compositus</em>, which may
have the same effect in modifying the solubility of the alum.</p>

<p class='c007'>In rubbing together different substances, it is necessary to remember
that there are many saline bodies, which in the dry state become moist
and even liquid, by triture with each other, and that, under such circumstances,
they are susceptible of mutual decomposition. This change is
effected by the action of water, derived from the following sources.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>From the water of crystallization.</em> This always operates when the
proportion contained in the original ingredients is greater than that which
the products can dispose of; that is to say, whenever the capacity of the
new compound for water is less than that of the original ingredients. By
previously driving off this water by heat, we shall of course avoid such a
source of solution, and no liquefaction can ensue. Thus, if recently burnt
quick-lime be triturated with calomel, the resulting mixture will be white,
shewing that no decomposition can have arisen, but add a few drops of
water, and it instantly assumes a dark aspect. If <em>crystallized</em> sulphate of
copper be triturated with Acetate of lead, the resulting mixture will assume
a fine green colour, but if the sulphate of copper be previously heated,
and its water of crystallization driven off, no change of colour will be
produced; if, for Acetate of lead, we substitute muriate of lime, and the
sulphate of copper be <em>crystallized</em>, we shall obtain a result of a yellow colour,
but if the sulphate of copper be <em>anhydrous</em>, the product will be colourless,
becoming however instantly yellow, like the former, on the addition
of a drop of water; and on a further addition of this fluid, the yellow
product in both instances will be rendered blue; which proves that a chemical
decomposition has taken place, and a muriate of copper resulted;
for this salt is rendered <em>yellow</em> by a small, and <em>blue</em> by a larger proportion
of water. The <em>Cuprum Ammoniatum</em> presents another illustration, for the
ingredients, when rubbed together, become extremely moist, and undergo
a chemical decomposition. Certain resinous bodies also, as <em>myrrh</em>, become
liquid by triture with alkaline salts, in which case the resin and alkali
form a soluble compound, which the water of crystallization, thus set
at liberty, instantly dissolves.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>From aqueous vapour in the atmosphere.</em> The water of the atmosphere
does not act upon these occasions, unless it be first attracted and absorbed
by one of the triturated bodies; e. g. if Acetate of lead and recently
burnt alum be triturated together, no change will be produced; but, if
the burnt alum be previously exposed for a short time to the atmosphere,
these bodies will, in that case, become liquid.</p>

<p class='c007'>The physician, without this chemical knowledge, will be often betrayed
into the most ridiculous blunders, an instance of which very lately came
to my knowledge in a prescription for the relief of cardialgia and constipation,
in the case of dyspepsia; it directed <em>sulphate of soda</em> and <em>carbonate of
potass</em>, in the form of a powder, but the <em>fiat</em> of the physician, upon this occasion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>only served to excite the ridicule of the dispenser, who soon discovered
that the ingredients in his mortar dissolved into liquid.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the exhibition of powders containing insoluble matter, it is
always important to maintain a regularity in the alvine excretions, or an
accumulation may take place attended with very distressing symptoms.
Dr. Fothergill relates a case of this kind which succeeded the use of powdered
bark; and Mr. E. Brande has communicated a similar instance of
mechanical obstruction, produced by the habitual use of magnesia. I
could also add, if it were necessary, some striking facts of a similar tendency,
which occurred from eating bread that had been adulterated with pulverized
<em>felspar</em>. The precaution seems more particularly necessary in the
case of children, whose bowels are very impatient of extraneous and insoluble
contents.<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c015'><sup>[296]</sup></a> The dose of a powder ought not to exceed ʒj; and,
when taken, should be diffused in water, wine, or any other convenient liquid;
resinous and metallic powders require a thick and consistent vehicle,
as syrup or honey, since they subside from those which are more fluid.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>PILULÆ. <em>Pills.</em></h4>

<p class='c018'>These are masses of a consistence sufficient to preserve the globular
form, and yet not so hard as to be of too difficult solution in the stomach.
The subject offers some extremely interesting points of inquiry. The following
general rules will enable the practitioner to select those substances
to which the form of pill is adapted, and to reject those to which it is not
suitable, as well as to direct, <em>extemporaneously</em>, the most efficient mode of
preparation.</p>

<h5 class='c034'>I. <span class='sc'>The Selection of Substances.</span></h5>

<p class='c018'>1. <em>Suitable Substances</em> are, 1, All remedies which operate in small doses,
as <em>Metallic Salts</em>; and 2, Those which are designed to act slowly and gradually,
as certain <em>Alterative Medicines</em>, or 3, which are too easily soluble
when exhibited in other forms, as <em>Gamboge</em>, &amp;c. 4, Substances which are
not intended to act until they reach the larger intestines, as in pills for habitual
costiveness; <em>see Aloes</em>. 5, Bodies whose specific gravities are too
considerable to allow their suspension in aqueous vehicles. <em>Efflorescent</em>
salts may also be exhibited in this form, but they ought to be first deprived
of their water of crystallization, or the pills composed of them will crumble
into powder as they dry.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>Unsuitable Substances</em> are, 1, Those which operate only in large
doses. 2, Which deliquesce. 3, Whose consistence is such as to require
a very large proportion of dry powders to afford them a suitable tenacity, as
<em>oils, balsams</em>, &amp;c. 4, Substances that are so extremely insoluble, that when
exhibited in a solid form they pass through the canal unaltered, as certain
<em>extracts</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Many remedies which are incompatible with each other in solution, may
be combined in pills, unless indeed their medicinal powers are adverse or
inconsistent, or their divellent affinities sufficiently powerful to overcome
their state of aggregation.</p>

<h5 class='c034'>II. <span class='sc'>Their Formation into Masses.</span></h5>

<p class='c018'>This is a subject of far greater importance than is usually assigned to it,
as will be more fully explained in the sequel.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Many substances, as <em>vegetable extracts</em>, may be formed into pills without
any addition; others, as <em>gum resins</em>, become sufficiently soft by being
beaten, or by the addition of a drop or two of spirit, or <em>liquor potassæ</em>.
Some dry substances react upon each other, and produce, without the addition
of any foreign matter, soft and appropriate masses. The <em>Pilulæ
Ferri Compositæ</em>, of our Pharmacopœia afford a very striking example of
this peculiar change of consistence, which the mutual reaction of the ingredients
produces by simple triture. The <em>Pilulæ Aloes Compositæ</em> offer
another instance; for the extract of gentian, upon being triturated with
aloes, produces a very soft mass, so that the addition of a syrup, as directed
by the Pharmacopœia, is quite unnecessary. See <em>Form: 12</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Many substances are, in themselves, so untractable, that the addition
of some matter foreign to the active ingredients, is absolutely essential
for imparting convenience of form. It is generally considered that
very little skill and judgment is required in the selection of such a substance,
provided it can fulfil the <em>mechanical</em> intention just alluded to—the
fact however is, that <em>the medicinal power of the pill may be materially controlled,
modified, or even subverted, by the mode in which it is formed into a mass</em>.
Where the active element of a pill is likely to be improved by minute division,
a gummy or resinous constituent may be usefully selected: under
the history of Aloes, I have alluded to a popular pill, known by the name
of the <em>dinner-pill</em>, in which case the <em>mastiche</em> divides the particles of the
aloes, and modifies the solubility of the mass. The <em>Pilulæ Opii</em> of the former
Pharmacopœia of London, consisted of equal proportions of opium
and extract of liquorice, and the mass was so insoluble that its effects were
extremely uncertain and precarious; in the present edition, soap has been
very judiciously substituted; but in certain cases where we wish to protract
the influence of opium, or that of any other active body, so as not to
obtain its full effects at once, we may very advantageously modify its solubility
by combining it with a gum resin or some substance which will
have the effect of retarding its solution in the stomach. The <em>Pilulæ
Styrace</em> of the Dublin college, presents itself as an efficient example of this
species of pharmaceutical address; see also <em>Form. 10, 11, 12</em>. I am well
acquainted with many formulæ whose utility has been sanctioned by experience,
and I have no hesitation in believing that their salutary mode of
operation would receive a plausible explanation from this simple law of
combination. Dr. Young has very justly stated in his Medical Literature,<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c015'><sup>[297]</sup></a>
that the <em>balsam of copaiba</em> envelopes metallic salts, so as to lessen
their activity; he says that the sub-carbonate of iron, made into pills with
copaiba, was given for some weeks without any apparent effect; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>that a few hours after the same quantity had been given, with gum only,
the fæces were perfectly black. I do not know a more striking and instructive
proof of the influence of a glutinous or viscid constituent, in wrapping
up a metallic salt, and defending the stomach from its action, than
is presented in the case published by the medical attendant Mr. Marshall,
in consequence of the attempt of Eliz. Fenning to poison the family of Mr.
Turner of Chancery-lane by arsenic, which she providentially administered
in a heavy yeast dumpling. <em>Soap</em> is very frequently used for the formation
of pill-masses, and it is an excellent constituent for substances likely
to be injured by meeting with an acid in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>; many resinous
bodies may also be reduced to a proper consistence by soap, although in
prescribing it, its levity should be attended to, or otherwise the pills will
be too bulky; in general it will combine with an equal portion of any resinous
powder, as <em>Rhubarb</em>, <em>Jalap</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em>; it is of course ineligible where
the substances are decomposed by alkalies, as <em>Tartarized Antimony</em>; this
last precaution will also apply to <em>aromatic confection</em> as a vehicle, on account
of the carbonate of lime contained in it. The <em>Conserve of Roses</em> has
the advantage of retaining its consistency much longer than mucilage,
but as it contains an uncombined acid, it is frequently inadmissible; it
could not for instance be with propriety employed with the precipitated
sulphuret of antimony. Pills made with mucilage, are apt to crumble
when they are rolled out; this is the case with the <em>Pilulæ Hydrargyri
submuriatis</em>; some extract therefore would be a more convenient constituent;
in this particular case, however, the addition of a few drops of spirit
would supersede the necessity of <em>any</em> constituent. Castor oil, in some
cases, especially with some of the harder purgative extracts, will impart
an eligible consistence.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Crumb of bread</em>, furnishes a convenient vehicle for those salts which are
ponderous, active in very small doses, or which are liable to be decomposed
by other vehicles; but an objection is attached even to this, for it is
liable to become so dry and hard when kept, that pills made with it will
frequently pass undissolved. Swediaur mentions this fact with reference
to Plenck’s mercurial pill, as well as to one of corrosive sublimate, and he
proposes for this reason to substitute <em>starch</em>; the addition however of a
small portion of sugar will prevent the bread from becoming thus indurated,
and with such a precaution it may be very safely employed. For the
purpose of forming active vegetable powders into pills, such as <em>Digitalis,
Conium</em>, &amp;c., I am informed by Mr. Hume of Long Acre, that in his experience
<em>melasses</em> or <em>treacle</em> is the best constituent that can be selected, for
it undergoes no decomposition by time, but maintains a proper consistency,
and preserves the sensible qualities of the plant quite unimpaired for many
years. I have deposited in the cabinet of the College, specimens of such
pills, of <em>hemlock</em> and <em>foxglove</em>, which retain the characteristic odour of these
vegetables, notwithstanding they have been now made for several years.
<em>Honey</em> has likewise the property of preserving vegetable substances; <em>seeds</em>
may be kept in it for any length of time, some of which, on being taken
out, washed, and planted, will even vegetate. It has also been used for
the preservation of animal matter; the bodies of the Spartan kings, who
fell at a distance in battle, were thus preserved, in order that they might
be carried home.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c015'><sup>[298]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span><em>Water</em> will on some occasions be found a convenient expedient; powdered
<em>Rhubarb</em> or <em>Jalap</em> may be thus made into masses without any increase
of bulk, but the pills will be apt, if kept, to become mouldy.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. In the formation of pills the ingredients should be hastily rubbed together,
whenever they are liable to be injured by long exposure to the
air; thus in the formation of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pilulæ Hydrargyri submuriatis compositæ</span></i>, the
compound is rendered less active by too long continued triture. See <em>Pulveres</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. In dividing pill-masses, it is usual to add to them, and envelope
them in, magnesia; where calomel is present, I have satisfied myself by
experiment that a <em>muriate of magnesia</em> is formed under such circumstances,
and it is owing to this partial decomposition, that the surface of the pill
exhibits a greenish hue; starch, powder of liquorice,<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c015'><sup>[299]</sup></a> or orrice root,
might perhaps under such circumstances be more judiciously preferred.
In Germany, the powder of <em>Lycopodium</em> is generally used. Formerly,
the pill was covered with gold leaf, which protected it from the influence
of the stomach, and frequently rendered it unavailing.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been observed that many of the pill-masses directed in our Pharmacopœias,
are liable to become so hard<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c015'><sup>[300]</sup></a> and dry by being kept, that
they are unfit for that division for which they were originally intended;
indeed Dr. Powel considers it doubtful whether the greater number of articles
had not better be kept in powder, and their application to the formation
of pills left to extemporaneous direction; the necessity of this is farther
apparent, when we learn that it is a common practice for the dispenser
to soften these masses by the application of a hot spatula, or pestle,
which sometimes carbonizes, and frequently decomposes them.</p>

<h5 class='c034'>III. <span class='sc'>Their Form of Prescription.</span></h5>

<p class='c018'>In our extemporaneous directions, it is necessary to apportion with accuracy
the quantity of active materials which we may wish each pill to
contain, and since the proportion of the <em>constituent</em> can rarely be exactly
defined, the equable division of the whole mass, into a given number of
pills, will be safer than defining the weight of each pill.</p>

<p class='c007'>A pill, the bulk of whose ingredient is vegetable matter, ought not to
exceed five grains in weight, but where the substances which compose it
are metallic and ponderous, it may without inconvenience weigh six or
even eight grains.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>
  <h4 class='c034'>TROCHISCI. <em>Troches</em>, or <em>Lozenges</em>.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>As these are regarded as objects rather of confectionary than of pharmacy,
the London and Dublin Colleges have not condescended to notice
them; the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia, however, contains several formulæ
for their preparation; and as the form of lozenge offers a very commodious
and efficacious method of administering certain remedies, the theory of its
operation deserves some notice in the present work. It is principally useful
in cases where it is an object that the remedy should pass <em>gradually</em>
into the stomach, in order to act as powerfully as possible upon the pharynx
and top of the trachea, as in certain demulcents or astringents; for instance,
<em>Nitre</em>, when intended to operate in relaxed or inflamed states of
the tonsils, is best applied in this manner; so is <em>Sulphate of Zinc</em> in chronic
coughs, attended with inordinate secretion. In order to retard as long as
possible the solution of the lozenge in the mouth, it ought to be composed
of <em>several</em> demulcent substances, such as farinaceous matter, sugar, gum,
and isinglass; for such a mixture will be found to answer the purpose better
than any <em>one</em> of these articles taken by itself; thus the farinaceous
matter will prevent the sugar and the gum from being too soon dissolved;
the viscidity of the sugar and gum will prevent the farinaceous matter
from being swallowed as soon as it would otherwise be; and the isinglass
will give a softness to the whole, and thus prevent any sharp points from
stimulating the membrane.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>SUPPOSITORIA. <em>Suppositories.</em></h4>

<p class='c018'>This form of preparation is very ancient, and although it has of late
years fallen into disuse, it affords an efficacious mode of administering many
powerful remedies, and in some instances of producing effects which the
same medicine would not command if given in any other form: besides
which, it is found that after the stomach by long use has lost its susceptibility
to the action of medicine, such a substance will operate with fresh
and unabated force if applied to the rectum. There are two great indications
which <em>Suppositories</em> are calculated to fulfil, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i></p>

<p class='c007'>1, <em>The alleviation of pain and irritation</em>, especially when it arises from
diseases of the bladder, prostate gland, uterus, and other parts in the vicinity.
Abortion may be thus frequently prevented. To fulfil these intentions,
a mixture of opium with two parts of soap, will be found eligible.
I can recommend such an application from a well grounded experience in
its efficacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>2, <em>The production of Catharsis</em>. In cases of Apoplexy, from the counter-irritation
which these remedies are likely to occasion, much advantage
may arise; and in the failure of more common measures, they may be applied
with certain success in the cure of Ascarides; see <em>Formula 146</em>.
Where a very efficient Suppository is required, one or two grains of <em>Elaterium</em>
rubbed up with eight grains of hard soap, will present us with a
combination of great utility.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>
  <h4 class='c034'>ELECTUARIA. <em>Electuaries.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>This is an ancient form of prescription; for although the term “<em>Electarium</em>”
is first used by Cælius Aurelianus, yet the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκλὶκτον</span> of Hippocrates,
and the <em>Antidotus</em>, <em>Confectio</em>, <em>Mithridatium</em>, <em>Diascordium</em>, <em>Opiatum</em>,
<em>Orvietanum</em>, <em>Philonium</em>, <em>Theriaca</em>, and <em>Requies</em> of other authors, were all
Electuaries. They differ from <em>Conserves</em> in this, that the sugar in the latter
preparations is in a greater proportion, and is intended to <em>preserve</em> the
ingredients; whereas in the former, it is merely intended to impart convenience
of form; see <em>Confectiones</em>. Electuaries are in general, <em>extemporaneous</em>
preparations, composed of dry powders, formed into a proper consistence
by the addition of syrup, honey, or mucilage; when however
the latter substance is employed, the electuary very soon becomes dry and
hard: and when common syrup is used, the compound is apt to candy,
and in a day or two to grow too hard for use; this is owing to the crystallization
of the sugar; Deyeux therefore states, that the syrup should
be previously exposed to the heat of a stove so long as it forms any crystals,
and that the residual liquor, which from the presence of some vegetable
acid has no tendency to crystallize, may then be advantageously applied;—<em>Melasses</em>
or Treacle may in some cases be employed, and from experiments
which I have repeated with some care, I am enabled to state
that the peculiar flavour of this liquid is entirely removed by a simple operation,
which consists in diluting it with an equal weight of water, and
then boiling it with about one eighth part of powdered charcoal for half
an hour, when the liquor is to be strained, and reduced by gentle evaporation
to a proper consistence;<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c015'><sup>[301]</sup></a> and moreover it appears, that active vegetable
powders retain their characteristic qualities when immersed in <em>treacle</em>,
longer than in any other excipient.</p>

<p class='c011'>In selecting and prescribing this form of exhibition, the following general
rules should be observed.</p>

<p class='c047'>I. Those substances which are nauseous, deliquescent, which require
to be given in large doses, or which are incapable of forming an
intimate union with syrup, as <em>fixed oils</em>, <em>balsams</em>, &amp;c. should never
be prescribed in the form of an electuary.</p>

<p class='c047'>II. The quantity of syrup directed must be regulated by the nature
and specific gravities of the substances which enter into their composition,
viz.</p>

<p class='c056'>1. <em>Dry Vegetable Powders</em> require twice their weight of syrup, or of
honey.</p>

<p class='c056'>2. <em>Gummy and Resinous Powders</em> require an equal weight.</p>

<p class='c056'>3. <em>Hard Mineral Substances</em> should be formed into an electuary with
some conserve, as they are too ponderous to remain suspended in
syrup. It deserves also to be noticed, that in consequence of the
readiness with which metallic preparations undergo change, it
will be generally adviseable to keep the active ingredients in the
form of powder, and to add them to the syrup only just before they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>are required; the Electuary of the French Pharmacopœia, which
is commonly called “<em>Opiata Mesenterica</em>,” will furnish a good example,
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quantumvis molle fuerit recens, progressu temporis, ob ferrum
quod ipsi inest, mirè indurescit</span></i>.”</p>

<h3 class='c017'>LIQUID FORMS.</h3>
<h4 class='c034'>MISTURÆ. <em>Mixtures.</em></h4>

<p class='c018'>These preparations are generally <em>extemporaneous</em>, in which different ingredients
are mingled together in the liquid form, or, in which solid substances
are diffused through liquid, by the medium of mucilage or syrup:
for prescribing mixtures the following general rules may be laid
down.</p>

<p class='c047'>I. Substances which are capable of entering into chemical combination,
or of decomposing each other, ought not to be mixed together,
unless it be with a view of obtaining the new products as a remedy.</p>

<p class='c047'>II. Transparency is not a necessary condition,<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c015'><sup>[302]</sup></a> and hence insoluble
powders may be advantageously introduced into mixtures, if the
following precautions be observed.</p>

<p class='c056'>1. They must be divisible and mechanically miscible in the liquid.</p>

<p class='c056'>2. They must not possess too great a specific gravity.</p>

<p class='c056'>3. They must not render the liquid too mucilaginous or thick; <em>thus</em>,
f℥j <em>should seldom contain more than</em> ʒss <em>of a vegetable powder</em>, ℈ij
<em>of an electuary</em>, <em>and conserve</em>; <em>or</em> grs. xv, <em>or</em> ℈j <em>of an extract</em>.</p>

<p class='c047'>III. The taste, the smell, and the general aspect of the mixture should
be rendered as pleasant as possible; <em>thus milk covers the taste of
bark, of the tinctures of guaiacum and valerian, and that of lime water</em>;
<em>and a light decoction of the liquorice root disguises a bitter taste
more effectually than sugar</em>.</p>

<p class='c057'>The Physician may also produce occasional changes in the
appearance of his mixture, in order to reconcile a delicate taste to
its continuance; he never ought however to alter the essential
part of plans which he finds advantageous.</p>

<p class='c007'>A <span class='sc'>Draught</span> differs merely from a mixture in quantity; it is usually
taken at once, and should not exceed f℥iss; it should be always preferred
when,</p>

<p class='c047'>1. <em>The remedy is to be taken in a precise dose.</em></p>

<p class='c047'>2. <em>Whenever it is liable to spontaneous decomposition.</em></p>

<p class='c047'>3. <em>Whenever the action of the atmosphere occasions change.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>In apportioning the dose of mixtures, the following proportions are admissible,
although not perfectly accurate. A <span class='sc'>Table Spoon</span> full (<em>Cochleare
Amplum</em>) f℥ss. <span class='sc'>Dessert Spoon</span> (<em>Cochleare Mediocre</em>) more than
fʒij. <span class='sc'>Tea Spoon</span> (<em>Cochleare Minimum</em>) fʒj. A <span class='sc'>Wine Glass</span> (<em>Cyathus</em>)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>although very variable, may be estimated as containing f℥iss. The custom
of measuring the dose of a liquid by dropping it from the mouth of a
phial is very erroneous;<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c015'><sup>[303]</sup></a> it will therefore be proper to dilute an active
medicine that is to be so apportioned, with at least a triple quantity of water,
that its real dose may not be essentially altered by any slight variation
in the quantity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The temperature at which a liquid medicine should be given may perhaps
merit a few observations. In general, the ordinary degree of heat
is that which will best answer the intention, but in cases of dyspepsia, the
sense of weight and uneasiness, which often follows a dose of medicine,
will be prevented by giving it in a tepid state. This remark will apply to
the administration of the <em>Decoction of Sarsaparilla</em>; Refrigerants should of
course be given as cool as possible; Camomile Infusion, and other vegetable
Ptisans, which are designed to promote the operation of an emetic,
will be more efficient when warm. In delicate chlorotic females I have
sometimes found chalybeate draughts not only more efficacious, but less
distressing to the stomach, when exhibited in a tepid state.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>ENEMATA. <em>Clysters.</em><a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c015'><sup>[304]</sup></a></h4>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><em>“Lavamenta.”</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This form of applying a medicine furnishes the practitioner with many
valuable resources, although the remedy has not escaped its due share of
persecution. Paracelsus bestowed upon it the epithet “<em>turpissimum medicamentum</em>,”
and Van Helmont that of “<em>pudendum medicorum subsidium</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is calculated to fulfil the following indications, viz.</p>

<p class='c047'>1. <em>To promote the tardy operation of a Cathartic, or to evacuate the bowels,
where, from delicacy of stomach, medicines cannot be retained, or from debility
of body they cannot be safely administered.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>In the administration of a remedy of this kind, there are two essential
circumstances, independent of the <em>strength</em> of its ingredients, which will
modify its activity, viz. <span class='sc'>Impulse</span> and <span class='sc'>Quantity</span>, by which we obtain the
stimulus of distention; warm water without any adjunct may thus be
made the means of overcoming those unrelenting obstructions, which had
refused obedience to more common measures: Clysters, however, when
most forcibly urged, rarely reach beyond the sigmoid flexure of the colon,
and yet when the largest quantity of fluid which the bowels will admit is
introduced with considerable impulse, the local impression is so powerful
that it is at once extended by the medium of sympathy, through the whole
of the alimentary canal, and very thorough and copious discharges result.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>To induce extreme relaxation:</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Which is best effected by an infusion of Tobacco. See <em>Tabaci Folia</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>To produce Astringent and Anodyne, or Carminative effects.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Common starch, with the addition of Tincture of Opium, is the most
common and convenient form for this purpose. See also <em>Assafœtida</em>, <em>Terebinthinæ
Oleum</em>, and <em>Formulæ 8, 9, 29, 30</em>. In some cases the injection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>of <em>cold water</em> acts as a powerful astringent, and from its impression upon
the rectum, will frequently afford instantaneous relief in the piles.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>To destroy Ascarides.</em> See <em>Form. 164</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. <em>To act as an emollient fomentation.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>6. <em>To convey nutriment.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>In the administration of Clysters, for the fulfilment of any of the last five
indications, it is obvious, that the stimulus of distention should be avoided,
as being incompatible with our object; the quantity, or bulk of the solution,
ought to be also carefully graduated; to prevent, for example, the
opiate clyster from being too soon returned, Dr. Cullen has remarked that
it seldom should be made of more bulk than that of three or four ounces
of liquid, and this also of a very mild kind. In administering a bitter decoction
for the cure of Ascarides, the same precaution is necessary, or the
gut will suddenly contract and expel the clyster, which always acts with
more certainty when allowed to remain for some time. The proportions
of fluid vehicle necessary for the different stages of life, under ordinary circumstances,
may be stated as follows:—An infant at its birth, or soon
after, requires about one <em>fluid ounce</em>; a child between the age of one and
five years, from three to four <em>fluid ounces</em>; a youth of ten or fifteen, from
six to eight <em>fluid ounces</em>; and an adult may take twelve. With regard to
the dose of the active ingredient of a <em>Lavement</em>, it may be estimated as
triple of that taken by the mouth.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>INJECTIONES.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Under this head may be comprehended the various medicinal preparations
which are employed as local applications;—to the urethra for the
cure of gonorrhæa, and to the vagina for that of the different discharges to
which females are liable.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to the former of these it has been truly observed, that
“among the whole class of remedies employed for surgical purposes, there
is scarcely one which has occasioned a greater diversity of opinion;” to
enter however into an examination of this subject would be entirely foreign
to the intention of the present work; it is only necessary to state,
that for their preparation the same principles of combination, and the same
chemical precautions, apply, as have been already investigated under the
head <em>Misturæ</em>. In some cases the practitioner will find it useful to insure
the entire solution of his active ingredient; while in others, the presence of
a precipitate may enhance the efficacy of the application, as illustrated by
<em>Form. 62</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the preparation of injections for the cure of female discharges, it must
be remembered that, if they be of a vegetable nature, their efficacy wholly
depends upon the <em>Tannin</em> which they contain, and the prescriber must
therefore take care not to invalidate the force of this principle by any incompatible
additions.</p>

<p class='c007'>And it deserves to be remembered, that as <em>Tannin</em> has the power of coagulating
animal mucus, and of forming with it an insoluble precipitate,
its administration, as an injection, is liable to occasion the evacuation of
whitish or ash-coloured flakes, which will come away from time to time,
and excite in the patient’s mind, says Mr. Clarke, the apprehension that
she is voiding portions of the internal parts of the body, unless her mind
be prepared for the occurrence by a previous explanation, and which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>judicious practitioner will not neglect to afford. In some cases it will be
necessary to correct the irritating effect of the astringent by the addition
of a demulcent, as exemplified in <em>Form. 61</em>. In applying this form of remedy
an ivory syringe should be always preferred to one of pewter, whenever
the solution is likely to be affected by the contact of a metal.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>INHALATIONES. <em>Inhalations.</em></h4>

<p class='c018'>Under this general title may be comprehended two distinct classes of
volatilized substances, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i></p>

<p class='c007'>Dry Fumes (<em>Suffitus</em>), and Watery Vapours (<em>Halitus</em>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Before we enter upon the consideration of this particular form of remedy,
it may be necessary to state, generally, that it appears to be capable of
affording a very expeditious and powerful mode of affecting the body by
certain medicines. If the power of a remedy be so greatly modified by
circumstances affecting its solubility, as we have already proved, it cannot
be a matter of surprise that the still farther diminution of its cohesion
should occasion a corresponding influence upon its energies; indeed it
would appear that some few substances are entirely inert when applied
under any other form, see <em>Hydrargyrum</em>, in the after part of this work. We
are, moreover enabled by these means, to bring various bodies into immediate
contact with organs, which are inaccessible to such remedies in every
other state of aggregation. This observation applies more particularly
to the lungs, and the subject has lately occupied the attention of
a worthy and skilful physician, whose work<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c015'><sup>[305]</sup></a> is well entitled to the serious
consideration of the profession.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practice of causing patients to inhale various volatilized substances
appears to have been of very ancient date. It has been already stated
in this work (p. 39) that the fumes of Orpiment were directed to be
breathed by Galen, and that the practice has been adopted by practitioners
of later date.<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c015'><sup>[306]</sup></a> Few attempts of this kind however were made, until the
time of our countryman Bennet, the author of “<em>Theatrum Tabidorum</em>,”
who arranges volatilized substances into the two classes which have been
announced at the head of the present section, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> <em>Suffitus</em>, and <em>Halitus</em>.
The numerous trials which have been since made with the different gases
must be in the remembrance of every reader, but unfortunately, the injudicious
and empirical spirit with which these inquiries have hitherto been
conducted, has thrown such discredit upon the subject, that the practitioner
who should resume the investigation, must be prepared to hear his
understanding, or his integrity, questioned.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Suffitus.</span> <em>Fumes of Burning Substances.</em> The particular forms of
pulmonary disease in which Tar fumes appear to be most serviceable, are
of the chronic kind; where an inflammatory diathesis prevails, or any
tendency to hæmopthysis exists, the practice cannot be said to be free from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>danger. In treatment of hooping cough the inhalation of tar fumes have
been also said to be beneficial. For the mode of applying this remedy,
see <em>Pix Liquida</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practice of smoking the roots of <em>Stramonium</em>, <em>Tobacco</em>, &amp;c. might
with propriety be noticed under this head. With the respect to the former
of these remedies, much has been said and written, and asthmatic
patients have occasionally expressed a belief in its palliative powers; in
my own practice however, I have never met with any success that has
inspired my confidence. See <em>Stramonii Herba</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Halitus.</span> <em>Aqueous Vapours.</em> In certain catarrhal affections, when accompanied
with painful and difficult expectoration, benefit may be occasionally
obtained from the inhalation of the steam of hot water, or of vinegar
and water, the acid in this case assisting the expectoration, while the
whole acts as an emollient and soothing application to the tender and inflamed
vessels of the internal surface of the bronchial tubes. The same
practice is also highly serviceable in Cynanche Trachealis, and Tonsillaris.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Pneumonia, after the violence of the arterial excitement has been
reduced by depletory measures, the inhalation of the steam of hot water,
or decoctions of emollient herbs, will often contribute to the support of an
easy expectoration.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been already stated under the history of Expectorants (<em>page
106</em>), that in certain dry states of the air, the evaporation of water in an
artificially warmed apartment, is frequently attended with considerable
relief to the pulmonary patient.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Dyspnæa, attended with a spasmodic condition of the pulmonary
organs, vapours impregnated with sulphuric æther have been recommended
for inhalation. Dr. Pearson also states that the efficacy
of such an application is materially enhanced by dissolving in
it a portion of the extract of Conium. Dr. Bôotcher of Copenhagen,
has lately announced the utility of vapours of camphor, in complaints
affecting the cavities of the nose, throat, and chest. He states that
in the worst case of stoppage of the nose from catarrh, a piece of camphor
need only be kept for a few minutes before it, to obtain great relief;
the same application has been known to produce good in Cynanche Tonsillaris.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to apply such inhalations we may employ the inhaler invented
by Dr. Mudge, or if that instrument be not at hand, the spout of a tea
pot, or a common basin with an inverted funnel, will be found very convenient
substitutes.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>REMEDIES OF EXTERNAL APPLICATION.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This class of medicinal agents formerly comprised a much wider range
of forms than it at present contains; such as numerous <em>Epithems</em>; <em>Vapours</em>;
<em>Aromatic Bags</em>; <em>Medicated Quilts</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>The external remedies of the present day may be divided into two orders,
viz.</p>

<p class='c047'>1. Those whose effects are entirely <em>local</em>, as exemplified in the application
of certain <em>refrigerating</em> embrocations, <em>stimulating</em> cataplasms,
and <em>astringent</em> unguents.</p>

<p class='c047'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>2. Those which excite general effects, or produce an influence upon
parts remote from those to which the remedy is more immediately
addressed, as illustrated by the operation of mercurial liniments
and unguents, or by the general tonic effects of adhesive plaisters.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to the former of these divisions it is unnecessary to multiply
our remarks; the objects which they embrace belong more particularly
to the department of surgery, and from the investigation of the different
modes and forms of external application we shall hereafter derive very
ample and instructive illustrations. In considering the objects of the latter
division, a very interesting and important question immediately suggests
itself for our consideration—How far a medicinal substance, when locally
applied to the surface of the body, may be capable of affecting the general
system, or some of its more remote parts?—the experienced practitioner
will feel no hesitation in admitting numerous proofs of the existence of
such agency; and it would seem probable that topical applications may
produce general effects by several distinct modes of operation, viz.</p>

<p class='c047'>1. <em>By exciting an impression on the nervous system.</em></p>

<p class='c047'>2. <em>By modifying the cuticular discharge.</em></p>

<p class='c047'>3. <em>By being absorbed into the circulation.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>In considering the different forms of external applications, it will appear
that, for their extemporaneous construction, preparation, and application,
the same scientific knowledge, practical skill, and pathological acumen
will be required, as we have already stated to be so indispensably requisite
to enable the physician to prescribe, and the pharmaceutist to prepare the
various remedies intended for internal administration; although in regard
to the former, it may be stated generally that the prescriber will more frequently
be called upon to exercise that species of knowledge and address
which enables the practitioner to impart a convenient and efficient <em>consistency</em>
to his remedy; for an external application is far more dependent
upon this circumstance for its efficacy, than one intended for internal use.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>LOTIONES:</h4>

<p class='c018'>Remedies of a liquid nature, designed for external application.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under this generic term, which strictly signifies a <em>wash</em>, may be comprehended
several species of medicines, calculated for the fulfilment of different
indications, as <span class='sc'>Embrocationes</span>, <span class='sc'>Collyria</span>, <span class='sc'>Fomenta</span>, <span class='sc'>Linimenta</span>,
&amp;c. In some instances these applications are entirely local in their effects,
as where a morbid action of the skin is changed by a stimulating
lotion, as exemplified in the cure of Psora by the <em>decoction of Hellebore</em>, or
the relaxed vessels of the tunica conjunctiva of the eye, by an astringent
collyrium; in other cases, they operate upon parts not in contact with the
remedy, through the medium of sympathetic communication, as where
cholic and disorders of the bowels are abated by the application of warm
fomentations to the surface of the abdomen, or where paralytic affections
are relieved by pumping cold water on the part affected.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Embrocationes.</span> These, as the term<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c015'><sup>[307]</sup></a> denotes, are compositions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>spirit, decoctions, infusions, or other liquids, applied by <em>sprinkling</em> or rubbing
them on an affected part.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Linimenta</span><a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c015'><sup>[308]</sup></a> are understood to differ from embrocations in consistence,
the former being of an oily, or mucilaginous density, which increases their
efficacy by imparting a certain emollient power, in addition to their other
virtues. In popular language, however, liniment and embrocation are
generally considered synonymous terms. They constitute a valuable
class of remedies, and the observations which Dr. Percival has offered on
their utility well merit the attention of the medical practitioner. “Volatile
and antispasmodic liniments are highly useful remedies, and it is to be
lamented that external applications of this kind are not more frequently
employed, for there is just reason to apprehend that powerful effects might
be expected from them in various diseases.” In chronic affections of the
viscera, such applications appear highly serviceable, not only from the
friction to which they give origin, but from the influence of that species of
sympathy which appears to depend upon the mere proximity and continuity
of parts, and which, as Sir Gilbert Blane has observed, is particularly
displayed “in the containing on the contained parts, as that of the integuments
on the subjacent viscera.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Collyria<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c015'><sup>[309]</sup></a>.</span>—Liquid applications to the eyes. The Pharmacopœia
Chirurgica contains several different formulæ for lotions of this kind, some
of which are simply astringent, while others combine also the virtues of a
stimulant.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>CATAPLASMATA.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c015'><sup>[310]</sup></a> <em>Poultices</em>, or <em>Pultices</em>.</h4>

<p class='c018'>External applications of a pulpy, and somewhat coherent or tenacious
consistence.</p>

<p class='c011'>They are generally extemporaneous preparations, and are calculated to
answer several different indications, viz.</p>

<p class='c047'>1. As <span class='sc'>Stimulants</span>, e. g. <em>Cataplasma Sinapis</em>, <span class='fss'>L. D.</span> which generally inflames
the surface to which it is applied so much as to raise blisters;
common salt also, <em>muriate of soda</em>, constitutes the active ingredient
of a poultice which has lately been brought into considerable repute
for the reduction of indolent strumous swellings and enlargements
of the glands.<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c015'><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c047'>2. <span class='sc'>Antiseptics</span>—<em>Cataplasma Fermenti</em>, <span class='fss'>L.</span> (see p. 159.) A powerfully
antiseptic cataplasm may be also made by stirring finely powdered
charcoal into a common linseed meal poultice. A cataplasm of
the boiled carrot, beat into a pulp, has been likewise found very
effectual in sweetening foul ulcers.</p>

<p class='c047'>3. <span class='sc'>Sedatives.</span> The most efficient of these are composed of <em>Conium</em>,
<em>Digitalis</em>, or <em>Hyoscyamus</em>, and are eminently serviceable in cancerous
and scrophulous sores of a highly irritable and painful nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>to diminish their sensibility and correct the acrid discharges. See
<em>Form. 18</em>.</p>

<p class='c047'>4. <span class='sc'>Refrigerants.</span> In the formation of a cataplasm for this purpose
we must avoid the introduction of substances that are slow conductors
of caloric; suppose for example our object is to apply the
<em>sub-acetate of lead</em> in this form, it will in such case be judicious to
mix the linseed meal, with oatmeal, or crumb of bread; for if the
former substance be used singly, it is liable, from its tenacity, to
become hard and dry, and in that state to augment the temperature
which it was designed to diminish.</p>

<p class='c047'>5. <span class='sc'>Emollients.</span>—(The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> of these agents is explained at
p. 142.) For which purpose the common farinaceous poultice is
the most eligible, made by soaking slices of bread in milk, and
simmering them together over a gentle fire until they are reduced
to the proper consistence, which ought to be such as to prevent
its spreading farther than is designed, and yet not so hard as to
occasion any mechanical irritation; the whole is then to be beat
smooth with a spoon, and applied as warm as the patient’s feelings
will readily admit. Some practitioners have doubted the propriety
of milk as an ingredient in this composition, and have preferred
water as an excipient, not only because the former is very liable to
turn sour, but because it does not possess greater powers as an
emollient than water; the observations of the editor of the Pharmacopœia
Chirurgica upon this question are judicious, and worthy
our notice; “the objection,” he says, “will certainly hold good
whenever stale milk is made use of, or if the same poultice be
kept too long applied; but if the milk be fresh, and the poultice
renewed night and morning, we do not know any thing that occasionally
gives such ease and comfort to the patient as this form of
cataplasm. If water be substituted for milk, the poultice is seldom
of sufficient tenacity; it is true that this inconvenience may
be remedied by the addition of a little linseed meal, but in some
instances the meal appears to fret and irritate the skin so much,
that patients undergo considerable uneasiness from this cause; an
objection to which the cataplasm of bread and milk is seldom subject,
especially if it be not applied too hot.”</p>

<p class='c047'>Every substance, whether liquid or solid, may become an ingredient
in this species of composition, and although judicious and
experienced surgeons have of late very considerably improved the
form of their cataplasms, yet the principles of medicinal combination,
which it has been the object of the present work to investigate
and expound, will suggest many important hints for the farther
extension of their utility; and although the direction of them
is more frequently left to the nurse than to the medical practitioner,
yet in adapting them to each particular occasion some share of
chemical address may be necessary; we have already seen that
attention must be paid to the selection of ingredients, with respect
to their powers of conducting heat, and it is evident that care must
be taken not to reduce into pulp, by decoction, substances that contain
volatile principles; while in the preparation of active liquids
to be subsequently mixed with linseed meal, it is equally evident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>that we must be directed by the chemical nature of their composition.</p>

<h4 class='c034'>EMPLASTRA. L.E.D. <em>Plasters.</em></h4>

<p class='c018'>These are solid and tenacious compounds, adhesive at the ordinary heat
of the human body; they owe their consistence to different causes, viz.</p>

<p class='c047'>1. <em>To a due admixture of wax or fatty matter</em>, <em>and resin</em>, e. g. <em>Emplast:
Ceræ</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>They may be said to differ only in <em>consistence</em> from liniments, ointments,
and cerates; Deyeux<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c015'><sup>[312]</sup></a> accordingly proposes to distinguish them by the
appellation of <em>Solid Ointments</em>.</p>

<p class='c047'>2. <em>To the chemical combination of the semivitreous oxide of lead with oils
or fat</em>, e. g. <em>Emplast: Plumbi</em>.</p>

<p class='c047'>3. <em>To the chemical action of the component parts of the plaster on each other</em>,
as <em>Emplast: Ammoniaci</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plasters are generally kept in rolls, wrapped in paper, and when to be
used they are melted and spread on leather; in performing this operation
the practitioner ought not to apply a heat above that of boiling water;
for if metallic oxides be present, the fatty matter will, at a higher temperature,
reduce them, in consequence of the powerful affinity of oil for oxygen
at an exalted temperature; and if aromatic substances enter as ingredients
they will thus suffer in their strength, besides which the fat itself
will undergo a very injurious change by a mismanaged application of
heat, and the plaster will be less adhesive.</p>

<p class='c007'>They are employed as remedies to answer two general indications; <em>mechanically</em>,
to afford support to muscular parts and to prevent the access of
air; and <em>medicinally</em>, to operate as stimulants, discutients, rubefacients, or
anodyne applications. That by affording an artificial support to the various
parts of the body, by the application of plasters, we are capable in
certain diseases of effecting much benefit, is a truth to be explained upon
the principles of physiology, and is daily confirmed by the results of practice;
thus by giving support to the muscles of the back, how frequently
the stomach is steadied and strengthened? Diseases of the kidneys are
in the same way very frequently relieved by tight bandages around the
loins; the existence of an intimate connexion between the external and
internal parts is strikingly exemplified by the distressing effects which are
often experienced in weak habits, such as sickness, giddiness, and other
uneasy sensations, from a want of any usual compression, as that of stays,
under-waistcoats, &amp;c. The support afforded to persons who have been
tapped in Ascites is another instance. I have also lately met with a case
in which a morbidly relaxed state of the bowels had harassed the patient
for several years, and set at defiance every astringent medicine; upon the
application, however, of a tight bandage around the abdomen, the healthy
action of the intestines has been completely restored. Sir Gilbert Blane
has suggested the trial of mechanical compression of the head in the cure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>of Hydrocephalus, and several cases, apparently favourable, have been
published. Dr. Thackrey of Cambridge has related a very interesting
history in support of the practice, and judiciously recommends the substitution
of straps of adhesive plaster for the bandages of cloth originally
proposed by Sir Gilbert. In reasoning upon this treatment, it will be found
strictly conformable with the soundest principles of physiology, and with
those views in particular, for the illustration of which I have here directed
the reader’s attention to the subject. Where our object is simple support,
we should of course select a plaster which is the most adhesive and the
least irritating. Many plasters which have gained great celebrity for their
curative virtues will be found to owe all their powers to their adhesiveness,
such is the <em>Emplastrum Oxidi Ferri Rubri</em> of the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia,
for it is impossible that the iron should communicate any tonic effect.
The same observation applies to many of those empirical plasters which
have at different times acquired so great a share<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c015'><sup>[313]</sup></a> of popular applause.
In the cure of sore legs<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c015'><sup>[314]</sup></a> the importance of adhesive strapping is generally
acknowledged, and on such occasions nothing is superior to the <em>Emplastrum
Resinæ</em>.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Explanation of the Key Letters.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The <em>Modus Operandi</em> of the different elements of each formula is designated
by a <span class='sc'>Key Letter</span>, or <em>Symbol</em>, which is printed in a different type,
(thus <b>B</b>) and placed in the margin opposite to each. This letter refers to
a corresponding one in the Synopsis, and thereby shews the division containing
an exposition of the principles upon which the operation of the ingredient
is supposed to depend.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two or more <span class='sc'>Key Letters</span> denote that the element against which
they are so placed has several modes of operation, whilst the order in
which the letters succeed each other, serves to shew the relative importance
of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where any one of the letters is <em>small</em>, <em>i. e.</em> not a capital, it denotes that
the operation which it is intended to express is only <em>incidental</em> to, or subordinate
in, the general scheme of the combination.</p>

<p class='c007'>When any number of elements are included within a <em>vinculum</em> or bracket,
it is intended to shew that they operate but as one substance, or, that
the virtues of each are not independent of the other; in this case the <span class='sc'>Key
Letter</span> within the bracket expresses upon what principle this unity depends,
whilst that on the exterior shews the action of such a combination
upon the base, or the part which it performs in the general scheme of the
Formula.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us exemplify it by a reference to <em>Formula 78</em> which presents us
with a Purgative, in conjunction with a Stimulant. The base is <em>Aloes</em>,
which is succeeded by <em>Scammony</em>, and <em>Extract of Rhubarb</em>; these substances
appear by the bracket, to act in unison, a concurrence which the interior
letter <b>B</b> shews to depend upon their being <span class='sc'>Similar Remedies</span>; the
letter also on the exterior shews that its operation upon the base depends
upon the same principle. We next come to powdered <em>Capsicum</em>, and <em>Oil
of Cloves</em>; these ingredients are also shewn by a bracket to act in unity,
and the letter <b>B</b> in the interior, denotes that it is in consequence of their
possessing a similar mode of action, whilst the letter <b>G</b> on the exterior,
announces that they act in the general scheme for the purpose of fulfilling
a second indication; at the same time the smaller letter <em>e</em> informs us that
the combination likewise acts as a <em>corrector</em> of the base.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c015'><sup>[315]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 id='OF' class='c010'><span class='small'>OF THE</span><br /> MEDICINAL DYNAMETER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>This instrument is capable of showing, on mere inspection, the absolute
as well as relative strengths of the different Officinal Preparations of the
Pharmacopœia. The active Principles, or Medicinal Bases, are distinguished
by <span class='sc'>Capital Letters</span>, placed in coloured compartments, and
each Officinal preparation is marked by a line corresponding in colour
with that of its active ingredient. Where a preparation contains two active
ingredients it is distinguished by two coloured lines, as may be seen
in the <em>Pulvis Ipecacuanhæ comp</em>. By this expedient the eye, at once,
recognises the different classes of medicines; all those, for instance, coloured
<em>red</em> are Opiates; those <em>blue</em>, Mercurials; <em>green</em>, Acetic acid; &amp;c.
The introduction of colours, moreover, immediately indicates the basis
to which any preparation refers, and thus prevents the possibility of doubt
or confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we wish to learn the actual quantity of active matter contained in
any given proportion of a compound, we have only to turn the scale until
the name of such compound coincides with the number in question, when
the figure opposite to the basis solves the problem; thus—how much
opium is contained in 5 grains of the <em>Pulvis Ipecacuanhæ compositus</em>? By
having brought this preparation to 5, we shall see ½ opposite to Opium,
denoting that such a number of grains contains half a grain; for, unless
it be otherwise expressed, the figures denote <em>grains</em> for the solids, and
<em>minims</em> for the liquids. And, since the number opposite to the Base denotes
the absolute quantity of it contained in those several proportions of
its Officinal compounds, which are expressed by the respective numbers
opposite to each, it follows that these latter must all be medicinally equivalent
to each other; thus we have seen that 5 grains of <em>Pulvis Ipecacuanhæ
compositus</em> contains ½ grain of Opium, if we turn our eyes to the
other Opiate preparations we shall perceive that each has a different
number opposite to it, these figures show the number of grains of each
which contains ½ grain of opium, and consequently those numbers must
be all Equivalents; thus 2½ grains of <em>Pil. Saponis comp:</em> 5 grains of the
<em>Pulv: Corn: ust: cum Opio</em>, 9½ minims of Tinctura Opii, 10 grains of
<em>Pulv: Kino comp:</em> 18 grains of <em>Confectio Opii</em>, 20 grains of <em>Pulv: Cretæ
comp: cum Opio</em>, and 120 minims, or two fluid-drachms of <em>Tinctura
Camphor: comp:</em> contain half a grain of Opium, and are consequently
all equivalent to each other. This system of Equivalents will be found
of much practical value to the practitioner, by enabling him, at once, to
substitute one preparation for another, without the risk of altering the
dose of its active ingredients. Suppose, for example, a patient had been
taking 8 fluid-drachms of <em>Mist: Ferri Comp.</em> and that we wish to give
the same quantity of Protoxide of Iron in the form of the <em>Pil: Ferri
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>comp</em>. we have only to bring the mixture in question to 8, and we shall
see 13½ grs. are equivalent, both these quantities of the respective preparations
containing ⅔ds of a grain of protoxide, or a little more than a
grain of the Proto-carbonate. Suppose again, that we have an acetic
acid of sp. gr. 1.059, and that we wish to produce, by its dilution, two
fluid-drachms, or any other quantity, of acid having the strength of distilled
vinegar, the question is, what are the proportions of water and
strong acid to be employed. We have only to bring the Acidum Aceticum
of 1.059, to 120, i. e. to fʒij, and the number opposite to the strong
acid, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> 16, is its equivalent, if therefore we take 16 minims of it, and
dilute it with 104 minims of water, we obtain the mixture required.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who are acquainted with the sliding rule of Gunter, or the chymical
scale of Dr. Wollaston, will immediately perceive that the present
circular scale is divided upon the same logometric principle, and that the
mechanical addition and subtraction of ratios here performed by juxta-position,
corresponds in effect to the multiplication and division of the
numbers by which the ratios are expressed in common arithmetical notation.
It is not necessary that I should trouble the reader with the numerous
difficulties and embarrassments which have opposed themselves
to the practical success of this instrument. They have, after repeated
failures, been at length overcome, except perhaps with regard to a slight
central error, which as it is found in the most accurate brass instruments,
could not be avoided where pasteboard alone had been employed. The
error, however, is not of the slightest practical moment, not occasioning
the difference of a hundredth part of a grain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proportions of active matter, in the several preparations of each
class, have been, in general, derived from the best authorities, although
in many cases they have been deduced from experiments expressly instituted
for the occasion.</p>

forming a viscid solution, (<em>mucilage</em>). One part dissolved in water affords
a fluid of the consistence of syrup; and in two parts, a medium well calculated
for the union of dry powders. Gum is also soluble in pure alkalies

with which it forms a mucilage that may be used as a cement, like
the watery solution, and with the additional advantage of not being
susceptible of mouldiness.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c015'><sup>[321]</sup></a> It is insoluble in alcohol, as well as in

Composition.</span> Acetic acid largely diluted with water, vegetable gluten,
mucilage, sugar, extractive matter, and frequently malic and tartaric
acids, together with small proportions of sulphate of lime, sulphate of
potass, and alcohol. Its composition however varies according to the
fermented liquor from which it is obtained:<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c015'><sup>[325]</sup></a> e. g. wine yields a paler,
purer, and stronger acid than fermented malt liquors or solutions of sugar,
hence the superiority of that prepared in France and Italy. Vinegar is
liable to spontaneous decomposition, or to become mouldy, and consequently
for the purposes of pharmacy it should be distilled; as however
the change depends upon the presence of gluten, it may if boiled be
kept for a much longer time, and if powdered <em>animal</em><a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c015'><sup>[326]</sup></a> charcoal be previously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>added, it will become quite colourless like distilled vinegar, and
that without being impaired in strength, whereas it always becomes much
weaker by distillation. It is a curious circumstance that this is the only
vegetable acid, except the <em>Prussic</em>, that rises in distillation in combination
with water.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> Sulphuric acid, as it does not produce any turbid appearance
in vinegar, is generally the acid selected for sharpening it; but
it must be remembered, that the maker is allowed by law, to mix one
thousandth of its weight of Sulphuric acid<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c015'><sup>[327]</sup></a> with it; so that the <em>muriate
of baryta</em> when added to such vinegar may be expected to produce 1⅕
grain of insoluble <em>sulphate</em> in every fluid-ounce; if a more considerable
quantity of precipitate occurs, we may infer that an excessive proportion
of sulphuric acid is present; although some allowance ought perhaps to
be made for the presence of the sulphates of potass and lime, which are
always contained in vinegar. Of this vinegar 1000 grains should saturate
148 grains of crystallized sub-carbonate of soda; a fluid-ounce of
the same, 68–3/4 grains.<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c015'><sup>[328]</sup></a> For the purpose of making the vinegar appear
stronger, acrid vegetables, as <em>grains of Paradise</em>, <em>berries of Spurge Flax</em>,
<em>Capsicum</em>, <em>Pellitory of Spain</em>, &amp;c. are sometimes infused in it, but by tasting
it with attention, the pungency of such substances may be easily
detected. For the other adulterations, see <em>Acidum Aceticum</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The purest vinegar which I have ever examined is that manufactured
from malt, by Mr. Mackintosh of Glasgow. The strongest malt vinegar
is termed <em>proof vinegar</em>, and is called by the manufacturer No. 24; it is
estimated to contain 4·73 per cent. of real acetic acid.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c015'><sup>[329]</sup></a> Its strength in
relation to the other forms of acetic acid, will be seen by referring to the
<span class='sc'>Medicinal Dynameter</span>, and to the table inserted under the article <span class='sc'>Acidum
Aceticum Fortius</span>. In the former Editions of this work it was
stated, that a Vinegar had of late years appeared in the market produced
from the distillation of wood, (<em>Pyroligneous Acid</em>.) This article has now
come into very general use; and the manufacturers have at length succeeded
in divesting it of that empyreumatic flavour which had so long
rendered it objectionable. See <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acidum Aceticum Fortius e Ligno destillatum</span></i>.</p>

(<em>Acetum</em>): <em>Taste</em>, less acid; <em>Colour</em>, none. <span class='sc'>Specific Gravity</span>; Mr.
Phillips states, that when prepared according to the directions of the Pharmacopœia,
it varies from 1·007 to 1·009; and that 1000 grains of the
latter require for their saturation, 145 grains of crystallized sub-carbonate
of soda. I apprehend, however, that it will be found quite impossible to
obtain a dilute acetic acid equal in strength or specific gravity, to that last
mentioned, by the process of the London College;<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c015'><sup>[331]</sup></a> it may even be doubted
whether it can be produced of the specific gravity 1·007. The general
run of distilled vinegar as found in the shop of the druggist, varies from
1·005 to 1·006, and contains from 2·80 to 2·826 per cent. of real acid;
when of the specific gravity of 1·009 it would contain about 4·73 per cent.
Dr. Powell states (<em>Translation of the Pharmacop: of London</em>, 1815) that
“one fluid-ounce ought to dissolve at least thirteen grains of <em>white marble</em>;”
or, what is equivalent to it, 39·67 grains of crystallized <em>Sub-carbonate of
Soda</em>; acid of this strength corresponds very nearly with six degrees of
the Revenue Acetometer, the proportions being as follow, 100 grains of
Pharmacopœia strength will saturate 8·68 grains of crystallized <em>Sub-carbonate
of Soda</em>; 100 grains of acid of 6° of the Acetometer will saturate
8·70 grains of the salt. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition</span>. Acetic Acid more
largely diluted than that in vinegar, with very minute portions of uncombined
mucilage and extractive. <span class='sc'>Solvent Powers.</span> It is capable of dissolving
all those vegetable principles which are soluble in water, and in
some cases, as in <em>Squill</em>, <em>Colchicum</em>, and in several <em>Aromatics</em> and <em>Narcotics</em>,
its acid appears to extend its solvent powers; at the same time it often
modifies or diminishes the medicinal virtues of the substances, as for instance
those of <em>Narcotics</em>; this circumstance considerably limits its pharmaceutical
application; when however it is employed, a portion of spirit
should be always added, in order to counteract the spontaneous decomposition
to which it is liable, and the acetic compound should be preserved
in stopped bottles. Acetic acid does not dissolve true resins, but it has
some action on gum resins. <span class='sc'>Medicinal Uses.</span> It is refrigerant, and
may be advantageously administered in hemorrhage; especially in cases
where the acetate of lead has been given, since the solubility of this latter
substance is increased by it. See Form. 57; externally, it may be a convenient
adjunct to lotions containing lead. <em>See Form. 147.</em> In consequence

answer for its detection in common vinegar, for the reason stated under

a little of the vapour into the lungs. The presence of <em>Nitric Acid</em> may
be discovered by saturating the suspected sample with pure potass, evaporating
to dryness, and then treating the product with a highly concentrated
alcohol, the acetate of potass will be thus dissolved, but as it exerts
no action on the <em>Nitrate</em> it will be found in the residuum, and may be recognised
by its deflagration, when thrown upon burning charcoal;<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c015'><sup>[332]</sup></a> <em>Copper</em>
may be detected by the acid assuming a blue colour, when supersaturated

a dark coloured precipitate. <em>Tin</em> however is the metal with which
distilled vinegar is more usually contaminated, for no vegetable acid will
act upon lead while any tin is present in the mixture, since the latter, being
more oxidable than the former, is exclusively dissolved.</p>

    <div class='c004'><em>vulgo, Pyroligneous Acid.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The acetic acid from wood has been very generally introduced to supersede
the use of distilled vinegar for the purposes of Medicine and the Arts.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c015'><sup>[333]</sup></a>
It is at length found to be capable of such complete separation from all
foreign matter as to afford a perfectly pure acetic acid, invariable in its
acidifying power, and immutable in its chemical properties. In justice to
the skill and industry of Messrs. Beaufoy and Co. of South Lambeth, I beg
to state that I have examined various specimens of this acid from their
manufactory, and that I find it free from those impurities which have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>hitherto constituted an insuperable objection to its introduction into the
Materia Medica. The purified <em>Pyroligneous</em> acid, manufactured by this
company, and sold under the name of “<em>Improved Distilled Vinegar</em>,” is perfectly
free from any unpleasant taste, as well as colour and sediment;
and it forms a limpid and colourless solution with ammonia. The common
distilled vinegar of the shops varies essentially in strength as well as
purity, differing in acidifying power from 30 to 40 per cent. in value: it is
sometimes 7 degrees, and at others less than 5, by the Revenue Acetometer;<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c015'><sup>[334]</sup></a>
and hence has arisen the difficulty of procuring an uniform article
for medical application, a difficulty which the introduction of the <em>pyroligneous</em>
acid seems calculated to overcome, as it may be procured from
the manufacturers of any degree of concentration,<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c015'><sup>[335]</sup></a> from 6 degrees of the
Acetometer, or 2·826 per cent. of real acetic acid to 130 degrees, or 61·49
per cent. of acid; and even of still higher strength if required; their common,
or <em>Proof</em> acid is about equivalent in strength to that of the best Malt
Vinegar, of which 100 grains will saturate 14½ grains of crystallized <em>Sub-carbonate
of Soda</em>, and consequently contains 4·73 per cent. of real acid,
and will require at least one half part of water to reduce it to the strength
of the best common distilled vinegar. It is found that acetic acid of 45
per cent. real acid, or of 95° of acetometer strength, dissolves Camphor
and the Essential Oils very readily.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “<span class='sc'>Acidum Aceticum Fortius</span>,” which is now introduced into
the Materia Medica of the London College, is directed to have a specific
gravity of 1·046.<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c015'><sup>[336]</sup></a> It is exactly six times the strength of Proof vinegar,
or the strong Malt vinegar manufactured, but it requires to be diluted
with nine times its weight of water to reduce it to the strength of the ordinary
samples of distilled vinegar. Mr. Phillips states, that he has not
met with acetic acid of greater specific gravity than 1·043,<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c015'><sup>[337]</sup></a> being five
times the strength of vinegar of specific gravity 1·009.<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c015'><sup>[338]</sup></a> The strongest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>acid that can be procured is the <em>Glacial</em> acid, which exists in a crystallized
state under 50° <em>Fah.</em> It contains 79 per cent. of real acid, and is consequently
of the strength of 167·5 of the Acetometer. If this acid be
kept perfectly still, it may be reduced several degrees below its crystallizing
point in a fluid state, when the slightest agitation of the vessel instantly
occasions it to solidify. It will greatly facilitate our inquiries into
the strength of different samples of acetic acid to know, that the representative
numbers of acetic acid and pure white marble coincide on the
scale of equivalents; it therefore follows that the weight of marble dissolved
by a hundred grains of any acetic acid, will at once represent the
percentage of real acid in such a sample.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Impure Pyroligneous acid, as it first comes over, contaminated
with Tar, has, it is said, been very successfully employed as a lotion in
Lepra, scrophulous ulcerations, chronic inflammation of the eyes, and
edges of the eye-lids, and for promoting digestion of irritative ulcers, or
those connected with carious bone. It has also been injected into sinuses
to produce healthy discharge and adhesive inflammation.<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c015'><sup>[339]</sup></a> M. Monge
discovered that this acid has the property of preventing the decomposition
of animal substances; it is sufficient to plunge meat for a few moments
in this acid, even slightly empyreumatic, to preserve it as long as you
please. “Putrefaction,” it is said, “not only stops but retrogrades.” To
the empyreumatic oil a part of this effect has been ascribed, and hence
has been explained the agency of wood smoke in the preservation of
tongues, hams, herrings, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>The process for this preparation has not retained its place in the London
Pharmacopœia, as it is now universally superseded by the Acetic
acid distilled from wood. Since however it possesses peculiar chemical
habitudes, it claims some notice in this work. The concentrated acid obtained
from the decomposition of acetic salts, by the action of sulphuric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>acid, is pungent, acrid, and volatile, and when heated with free access of
air, it takes fire very readily. Its solvent powers are much greater than
those of distilled vinegar; it is capable of dissolving camphor, resins, and
essential oils<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c015'><sup>[340]</sup></a> copiously, but they are precipitated by dilution; it combines
with alcohol, and forms a species of ether; with water it unites in
any proportion, heat being evolved by the mixture. Gold, platinum,
glass, and earthenware, can alone retain this acid without being corroded.
It blisters the skin immediately.</p>

<em>Tartaric Acid</em>, with which it is sometimes mixed, may be detected by adding
to the solution an excess <em>of Potass</em>, which will instantly form with it
an insoluble super-tartrate, and precipitate in granular crystals, or, if a
little of the suspected acid be saturated with potass, and then boiled with
a dilute solution of muriate of Platinum, if tartaric acid be present, a black
protoxide of Platinum will be precipitated. If we add the tartrate of
potass for this purpose, we may be deceived, for the citric acid, by neutralizing
a portion of its base, will convert the remainder into super-tartrate.
See <em>Potassæ Tartras</em>. <em>Sulphuric Acid</em> is known by the acetate of lead producing
a precipitate, insoluble in nitric acid. <em>Muriatic Acid</em> may be discovered
in the same manner, substituting only an acidulous solution of
nitrate of silver for the acetate of lead. The presence of <em>Oxalic Acid</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>may be inferred, if the solution, when added to that of sulphate of lime,
produce a precipitate. Malic acid has the power of precipitating silver,
mercury, and lead, from their solutions in nitric acid, but no doubt or difficulty
can arise from this circumstance, for the fact of its forming a soluble
salt with lime will prevent every chance of accidental intrusion, and
its price at once secures us against its fraudulent introduction; it might
moreover be easily detected by throwing the suspected precipitate upon
burning coals, when it would be decomposed. Where the presence of
<em>lime</em> is suspected, it may be known by dissolving some of the crystals in
water, saturating the solution with ammonia, and then treating it with the
oxalate of that alkali, which, if lime be present, will immediately separate
it in a palpable form. The juices of many other fruits besides the lemon
and lime, will furnish the citric acid in abundance, and may be obtained
from them by a similar process; e. g. <span class='sc'>Vaccinium oxycoccus</span>, the <em>Cranberry</em>;
<span class='sc'>Prunus Padus</span>, the <em>Bird’s Cherry</em>; <span class='sc'>Dulcamara Solanum</span>, the
berry of the <em>Nightshade</em>; <span class='sc'>Cynosbatus</span>, vel <span class='sc'>Rosa Canina</span>, the hep or
fruit of the <em>Wild Briar</em>. There are many plants whose juices contain combinations

<span class='sc'>Ribes Rubrum</span> the <em>Red Gooseberry</em>; <span class='sc'>Vaccinium Myrtillus</span>, the

<p class='c007'>This peculiar acid exists in a great variety of native combinations in the

work to dwell upon the merits of the different processes which have
been proposed for its preparation; for a full account of them, as well as for
other details of importance, the practitioner is advised to consult a work
by Dr. Granville, entitled “<cite>An Historical and Practical Treatise on the use
of Prussic Acid. Second Edition. London, 1820.</cite>”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> A colourless transparent liquid, although it occasionally

Composition.</span> The true nature of <em>Prussic</em> acid was not ascertained
until 1815, when Gay Lussac presented to the Royal Institute of
France, a memoir which at once developed its real chemical constitution;
and it is now admitted to consist of a peculiar gaseous and highly inflammable
compound of carbon and nitrogen, to which the name <em>Cyanogene</em>
has been assigned, and of hydrogen; the latter body acting as the acidifying
principle, whence the term <em>Hydro-cyanic</em> acid is well contrived to express
its composition. The medicinal, or <em>diluted</em> acid, however, contains
but a small proportion of this concentrated compound; according to M. Majendie,
one part of the acid of Gay Lussac and eight parts and a half of
water, by weight, or one part of acid with six times its volume of water,
constitute the preparation which should be used in medicine; and which,
to avoid the possibility of mistake, ought always to be prescribed as the
Acidum Hydro-cyanicum <em>dilutum</em>, and is, in fact, the <em>Prussic acid</em> of
Scheele. Dr. Ure, who has lately taken considerable pains upon this subject,
has constructed a table exhibiting the relations between the specific
gravities, and quantities of real acid, in preparations of different strength;
from these experiments it would appear that an acid of specific gravity
0·996 or 0·997 is such as is usually prescribed in medicine.<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c015'><sup>[342]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Medical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Uses.</span> In a sufficient dose, hydro-cyanic acid instantly destroys life by
extinguishing the nervous energy of the body;<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c015'><sup>[343]</sup></a> but it has at the same
time been observed that animals submitted to its action would often continue
to breathe for several hours freely, and to circulate their blood, although
no trace of sensibility or muscular contractility could be found after its application.
This remarkable property of extinguishing the general sensibility,
without any ostensible injury to respiration and circulation, naturally
led to a belief that the hydro-cyanic acid, or prussic acid, might be advantageously
used in cases of excessive sensibility and irritation, particularly
when these two morbid states are likely to affect either the respiratory organs
or the circulation generally. This kind of analogical reasoning, it is
said, induced Professor Brera, ten years ago, to administer it in cases of high
pulmonary and other inflammations, in doses of four drops twice a day;
when, as we are told, the violence of the disease was quickly subdued. The
remedy, however, does not appear to have excited much attention, until
after the first essay of Dr. Majendie, who deserves whatever credit may belong
to its introduction. Seven years of trial have elapsed, and the general
sense of the medical profession with respect to its utility may now be collected.
As a palliative in certain spasmodic coughs, there is reason for supposing
that it <em>may sometimes</em> be useful, but in that species of pulmonary irritation
for which it was at first so greatly extolled, I will venture to assert that
it is far inferior in efficacy to well directed doses of <em>Conium</em>. But there is
another class of diseases in which its exhibition is said to prove useful, in
dyspeptic affections attended with heartburn; where it is supposed to be
capable of reducing the morbid irritability of the stomach, and thereby of
enabling the juices of that organ to be more slowly secreted and of a more
healthy character. Dr. Elliotson has published the result of his treatment
of stomach complaints with this medicinal agent, and would appear to appropriate
to himself the merit of originating the practice, a claim which
Mr. Thomson, in the third edition of his Dispensatory, refuses to concede.<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c015'><sup>[344]</sup></a>
As a local remedy, prussic acid has also received no small share of commendation,
and it has been said that it is the only application that can be
depended upon for allaying the cutaneous irritation so frequently attendant
upon certain impetiginous affections. It must, however, be confessed that
this medicine is rapidly declining in popularity.<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c015'><sup>[345]</sup></a> Any prejudice raised
against it, upon the ground of its poisonous activity in large doses, is too
absurd to be believed; the knife and the caustic are unquestionably powerful,
and may therefore become dangerous instruments; but who ever
blames the surgeon for employing a sharp knife or an active caustic, seeing
that both are to be directed by his eye, and guided by his hand?
<span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span> It may be conveniently administered in any liquid
vehicle, as distilled water, camphor mixture, or in some vegetable infusion.
See <em>Supplementary Formulæ</em>, 1, 2, 3. A question has lately arisen
whether the effects of the prussic acid might not be more conveniently
ensured by the administration of some vegetable<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c015'><sup>[346]</sup></a> in which it exists as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>native ingredient; a company of associated Physicians, Surgeons, and
Naturalists at Florence, have accordingly expressed their joint opinion,
that the essential oil of the <em>Prunus Lauro Cerasus</em> is to be preferred in medical
practice to all other preparations which contain the hydro-cyanic
acid; for, say they, unlike the distilled water of the plant, and pure prussic
acid, it contains the same proportion of active matter, and of the same
power, whether recently prepared or not; whether made in one place or
another; or whether it has been exposed or not to the air, light, or heat.
They are also of opinion that olive oil forms the best vehicle for its exhibition
in the proportion of one ounce to twelve drops of the essential oil.
Other practitioners again prefer <em>Laurel Water</em>, made by distilling two
drachms of the fresh leaves chopped, with four ounces of water, recommitting
the distilled water twice afterwards on the same quantity of fresh
leaves, and making ultimately four ounces of the menstruum, of which
from ♏︎xxx to fʒj every six hours may be given until a sedative effect is
produced. See <em>Oleum Amygdalæ Amaræ</em>. <span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span>
Hydro-cyanic acid is decomposed by most of the <em>oxydes</em> usually employed
in medicine, particularly by those of <em>Mercury</em> and <em>Antimony</em>. The alkalies
do not appear to diminish its efficacy. <em>Nitrate of Silver</em>, and the salts
of iron occasion precipitates; nor ought the <em>sulphurets</em>, the <em>mineral acids</em>, or
<em>chlorine</em> to enter with it into prescriptions. <span class='sc'>Dose.</span> Of the medicinal, or
<em>diluted</em> hydro-cyanic acid, ♏︎ij,–viij. There is however considerable difficulty
with regard to the strength of the dilute acid employed in medicine,
since the density is a criterion of greater nicety than can be conveniently
used by the majority of practitioners; in fact, as Dr. Ure has observed, the
liquid at 0·996, contains about double the quantity of real acid, which it
does at 0·998. Dr. Ure has accordingly proposed another test of the
strength of this powerful and dangerous medicine, which is not only easier
in use, but more delicate in its indications;<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c015'><sup>[347]</sup></a> it is as follows. To 100
grains, or any other convenient quantity of the prussic acid, contained in a
small phial, add in succession, small quantities of the peroxide of mercury,
(the common <em>red precipitate</em> of the shops) in fine powder, till it ceases to be
dissolved on agitation. The weight of the red precipitate taken up, being
divided by four, gives a quotient representing the quantity of real prussic
acid present. By weighing out before hand, on a piece of paper, or a
watch glass, forty or fifty grains of the peroxide, the residual weight of it
shews at once the quantity expended. The operation may always be
completed in five minutes, for the red precipitate dissolves as rapidly in the
dilute prussic acid, with the aid of slight agitation, as sugar dissolves in water.
<span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> If, says Dr. Ure, the presence of muriatic acid be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>suspected, then the specific gravity of the liquid compared with the gravity
of the peroxide dissolved, will shew how far the suspicion is well
founded; thus if 100 grains of acid, specific gravity 0·996, dissolve more
than 12 grains of the red precipitate, we may be sure that the liquid has
been contaminated with muriatic acid. <em>Nitrate of Silver</em>, in common
cases, so valuable a reagent for muriatic acid, is unfortunately of little use
here, for it gives with prussic acid, a flocculent white precipitate, soluble in
water of ammonia, and insoluble in nitric acid, which may easily be mistaken
by common observers, for the <em>chloride</em> of that metal. But the difference
in the volatility of prussiate and muriate of ammonia may be had recourse
to with advantage; the former exhaling at a very gentle heat, the
latter requiring a subliming temperature of about 300° <em>Fah.</em> After adding
ammonia in slight excess to the prussic acid, if we evaporate to dryness at
a heat of 212°, we may infer from the residuary sal ammoniac, the quantity
of muriatic acid present.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Antidotes.</span> To counteract the poisonous effect of prussic acid, Orfila
recommends, after full vomiting has been excited, the exhibition of three
or four spoonsful of oil of turpentine, in the infusion of coffee, at intervals
of half an hour. M. Virey conceives that sulphate of iron in solution is
the best antidote, he having observed that the salt restored a cow that
was nearly killed by the essential oil of bitter almonds. When an overdose
has been taken, hot brandy and water, and the ammoniated tincture
of iron are recommended by Mr. Thomson; on the former I should rely
with much greater confidence than upon the latter antidote, or, in other
words, it is from vital agents, counteracting its sedative influence, rather
than from chemical substances, changing its composition, that we can expect
any benefit upon such an occasion. For the chemical processes by
which the presence of this acid may be ascertained, the reader may consult
my work on Medical Jurisprudence, vol. 2, p. 408.</p>

    <div class='c004'><em>Muriatic Acid.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> <em>Form</em>, a liquid of the specific gravity 1·16, a fluid-ounce
of which weighs about 527 grains, and according to Dr. Powell ought,
when diluted, to dissolve 220 grains of limestone. <em>Odour</em>, strong and
pungent; if exposed to the air it emits white fumes. <em>Taste</em>, intensely sour
and caustic; it is however the weakest of the three mineral acids; and
no remarkable elevation of temperature is produced by dilution. <span class='sc'>Chemical
Composition.</span> The liquid acid is a solution of muriatic acid gas in
water; when of the specific gravity 1·16, according to Davy, it contains
32·32 per cent of the gas, which recent experiments have shewn to be a
compound of <em>Chlorine</em> (<em>Oxy-muriatic acid)</em> and hydrogen in equal volumes.
It has therefore received a name expressive of its composition, and is called
<em>Hydro-chloric<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c015'><sup>[348]</sup></a> acid</em>. We accordingly find that the former element is disengaged
from muriatic acid by adding any substance capable of uniting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>with its hydrogen. For the purpose of obtaining <em>Chlorine</em>, we may take
three parts of common salt, one of black oxide of manganese, and rather
less than three of strong sulphuric acid.<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c015'><sup>[349]</sup></a> Accounts have been received
from Spain, that in the midst of the dreadful contagion which reigned in
that country, the inhabitants always escaped in those houses where fumigations
of chlorine had been used. In our own country, the Penitentiary
has lately undergone fumigation by this gas, under the superintendance of
Mr. Faraday.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c015'><sup>[350]</sup></a> Muriatic acid gas has also been strongly recommended for
the same purpose; it may be easily evolved by pouring sulphuric acid on
common salt. If nitric and muriatic acids be mixed, a mutual decomposition
takes place, of which water, chlorine, and nitrous acid are the results;
this constitutes “nitro-muriatic acid,” the <em>Aqua regia</em> of the older
chemists. A bath acidulated with an acid of this kind has been recommended
by Dr. Scott, as a powerful remedy for diseases of the liver in particular,
and as a substitute for mercury in general. On the possible influence
of this bath, I would beg to make one observation,—that the extensive
application of a dilute acid to the surface of the body, is, under
certain circumstances, capable of affecting the bowels. I have witnessed
such an effect from sponging with vinegar and water. In this way the
acidulated bath may occasionally produce benefit, but it is extremely difficult
to conceive how it can be indebted for its utility to any other mode of
operation. (See <cite>Journal of Science and the Arts</cite>, No. 2.) <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span>
Muriatic acid should be administered in some bland fluid, as
barley water, gruel, &amp;c. (<em>Formula 145.</em>) I have uniformly exhibited it
with success in the most malignant cases of typhus and scarlatina, during
several years extensive practice in the Westminster Hospital. See
<em>page 157</em>. We should be careful not to apportion its dose in a leaden or
pewter spoon. The antiseptic properties of this acid have been long
known; Sir Wm. Fordyce relates that a “dry-salter” acquired a large
fortune from possessing a secret that had enabled him to send out provisions
to India in a better state of preservation than any others of the
trade; his secret consisted in adding a small quantity of muriatic acid to
the contents of each cask. After a copious evacuation of the bowels, it
is in my experience the most efficacious remedy for preventing the generation
of worms; for which purpose the infusion of quassia, stronger than
that of the Pharmacopœia, is the best vehicle. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, ♏︎v-xx, frequently
repeated. It may be here observed that where the permanent
influence of an acid is required, a mineral one should be always preferred,
as such bodies appear to be beyond the control of the digestive process,<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c015'><sup>[351]</sup></a>
and are incapable of being decomposed by it; see <em>Form. 158</em>, whereas
on the contrary it seems probable that the organs of assimilation have
command over those of a vegetable nature, and generally decompose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>them. Dr. Marcet has very judiciously noticed this fact in his luminous
work on the treatment of calculi, and I have ventured to offer some farther
observations upon this subject, which may be of practical value, under
the consideration of <em>Lithonthryptics</em>, page 123. <span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span>
<em>Sulphuric acid</em> is detected by diluting the acid with six parts of distilled
water, and adding a few drops of the muriate of baryta, which occasions
a white precipitate if any be present. <em>Iron</em>, by saturating a diluted portion
with pure carbonate of soda, and adding prussiate of potass, which
will indicate its presence by a blue precipitate; or by a solution of ammonia,
which, when added slightly in excess, throws down the peroxide of
iron of a reddish yellow colour. <em>Copper</em>, by the production of a blue colour
when supersaturated with ammonia. The yellow tinge of the acid usually
met with in commerce, may depend either upon the presence of iron,
vegetable extractive, or a small portion of chlorine. This latter body
may be recognised by the odour, or by its power of dissolving gold leaf.</p>

by all combustibles, and when mixed with volatile oils, it causes their

As an escharotic it has been frequently employed for the destruction of
tumours, and is certainly of value where an immediate destruction of diseased
parts is required. The method of using the strong nitric acid in
such cases is to smear all the sound parts in the immediate vicinity of the
ulcer with <em>Ung: Resin: Nig:</em> and then to apply pledgets of lint firmly
upon the ulcer for a few seconds, by which the whole surface will be deadened,
and a deep slough remain, underneath which healthy suppuration
and granulations will ensue.<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c015'><sup>[352]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> <em>Sulphuric acid</em> may be

unless this as well as the nitric acid be diluted, a precipitate will occur, although
sulphuric acid should not be present; a circumstance which depends
upon the barytic salt yielding its water of solution to the acid under
examination, and becoming insoluble. <em>Muriatic acid</em> is discovered by
nitrate of silver, affording a precipitate at first white, but becoming coloured
by exposure to light; the nitric acid ought to be perfectly colourless,
but to preserve it in such a state it must be closely stopped, and kept in a

this purpose, in consequence of the acid disorganizing and carbonating the
vegetable and animal matter suspended in the atmosphere; it is therefore
evident that bottles in which it is preserved ought not to have stoppers of
cork, but those of glass. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> Like the other mineral
acids, it has never been obtained in an insulated state without water;
according to Davy, the composition of the strongest acid may be
thus expressed: sulphur 30, oxygen 45, water 17. It has a very powerful
affinity for water, and produces when mixed with it a very considerable
heat; exposed to the atmosphere it imbibes at least seven times its
own weight of water, and so rapidly as to double its weight in a month;
when of the specific gravity 1·85, it rises in vapour at about 550°, and
distils unaltered, whereas weaker acids lose water by being boiled, and
are brought to that degree of concentration; when diluted with 12 or 13
per cent. of water, an acid results of the specific gravity 1·780, and in
this state of dilution it boils at 435°, and freezes sooner than water; a
knowledge of this curious fact suggests to the prudent chemist an important
precaution; Mr. Parkes, in his Chemical Essays, vol. ii. relates the
occurrence of a terrible accident which happened in consequence of this
circumstance not having been attended to.—“Carboy after carboy burst
by the expansion of the acid in the act of freezing, and had not the packed
carboys that remained been immediately immersed in tepid water, not a
single one would have escaped the general wreck.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> The ordinary acid of the shops contains in general
3 or 4 per cent. of saline matter, which consists of about two-thirds of
sulphate of potass, and one-third of sulphate of lead. Dr. Ure observes,
that even more is occasionally found, in consequence of the employment
of nitre to remove the brown colour given to the acid by carbonaceous
matter; the amount of adulteration, he observes, may be readily determined
by evaporating a definite weight of the acid in a small capsule of
platinum; these impurities however in a medical point of view are immaterial,
since they are at once separated by dilution, but in a commercial
sense they deserve attention, as their presence considerably increases the
specific gravity of the acid. Dr. Ure is of opinion that genuine commercial
acid should never exceed 1·8485, and that any density beyond this
is the effect of saline combination. <cite>Journal of Science and the Arts,

with cold water this substance demeans itself differently, the acetate is
dissolved by it, whilst that portion which is in the state of <em>sub</em>-salt remains

Sulphuric acid poured on powdered <em>verdigris</em> decomposes it with effervescence,
and vapours of acetic acid are disengaged. It appears from the

balsams, resins, gum-resins, wax, camphor, extractive, &amp;c.; it takes up
about a twentieth of its weight of sulphur, but it exerts no solvent power

Æther, independent of such virtues, has another valuable property
consequent upon its rapid evaporation, that of producing cold and
dryness; it is therefore, when externally applied and allowed to evaporate,
a most powerful refrigerant, and has proved valuable in scalds or burns, in
facilitating the reduction of strangulated hernia, and in diminishing excessive
circulation in the brain; if however it be so confined, that its rapid
evaporation is prevented, a very opposite effect is produced, and it proves
stimulant, rubefacient, and even vesicatory. With regard to the other
property incidental to it, that of producing dryness, I am not aware that
it has hitherto been applied to any pharmaceutical purpose; the fact may
be satisfactorily shewn by a very simple experiment,—by rincing a phial
with æther, to the interior of which drops of water obstinately adhere,
when by exposing it to a current of air, it will be completely dry in a few
minutes. It may be noticed in this place that a mixture of sulphuric and
muriatic æthers evaporates instantaneously, and produces a degree of
cold considerably below 0 of Fahrenheit. <span class='sc'>Officinal Preparations.</span>

nearly pure. Alcohol unites chemically with water; and caloric is
evolved during this union; the quantity of alcohol and water in mixtures

It is a very common domestic remedy for the expulsion of tænia, and it is
undoubtedly of advantage in such cases; it is usually administered in the

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> The above varieties of aloe differ in their purity, and likewise
in their sensible qualities; the <em>Socotrine</em> is the purest, it is in small
pieces of a reddish brown colour; the <em>Barbadoes</em> is in large masses, of a
lighter colour, and having an odour much stronger and less pleasant;
the <em>Cabaline</em> is still more impure and less powerful. All the kinds are
characterized by an intensely bitter taste, which, in the <em>Socotrine</em>, is accompanied
by an aromatic flavour. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> In this
there appears to be some obscurity; M. Braconnot (<em>Ann. Chim. tom. 68.</em>)
conceives it to be a substance, <em>sui generis</em>, which he terms “<em>bitter resin</em>,”
while others regard it as composed of resin, gum, and extractive, the proportions
of which are supposed to vary in the different species, but that
their peculiar virtues reside in the extractive part. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> It is to
the slowness with which aloe undergoes solution in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>, that it
is indebted for the medicinal properties which distinguish this substance;
by boiling water it is dissolved, but on cooling a precipitation ensues, and
by long decoction it becomes quite inert; weak acids dissolve it more
abundantly than water, but proof spirit is the most perfect solvent: its
solubility is increased by the addition of alkaline salts and soaps, but by
such a combination it undergoes a material change in its medicinal properties;
the bitterness is diminished, its purgative effects impaired, and it
ceases to operate specifically upon the large intestines, a fact so far valuable,
as it enables us in certain cases to obviate its irritating action upon
the rectum. <span class='sc'>Medicinal Use.</span> Aloe is a bitter stimulating purgative,
emptying the large intestines, without making the stools thin; it likewise
warms the habit, quickens the circulation, and promotes the uterine and
hemorrhoidal fluxes. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, gr. v.–xv. No greater effect is produced
by a large dose than from one comparatively moderate; its tendency,
however, to irritate the rectum renders it, in many cases, an objectionable
remedy;<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c015'><sup>[363]</sup></a> and its sympathetic action on the uterus may occasionally produce
mischief, in irritable habits, while in other states it may, for reasons
equally obvious, prove beneficial. <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span> The form of
pill should be preferred on account of its extreme bitterness, as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>being, for the reasons above mentioned, the one most likely to fulfil the intention
of its exhibition; for in addition to what has been stated in a preceding
part of this work, on the important influence of solubility, it may be
here observed that since the aloe does not undergo solution in the stomach,
it is admirably adapted for the basis of remedies intended to obviate constitutional
costiveness, for in our endeavours to supply the deficiencies of
nature by the resources of art, we should at least attempt to imitate the
modes of her operation; the natural stimulus of the intestines, the bile,
is poured into them below the stomach, and whenever it regurgitates into
that organ it produces disease; so it happens with our cathartic medicines,
and unless we so modify their solubility that their operation cannot commence
until after their passage through the stomach, we shall find that
we only increase the evil we are endeavouring to obviate, and that, in
addition to the torpor of the intestinal canal, we shall induce the stomach
to participate in the disease, or excite a morbid fretfulness of that organ
which will be attended with the most distressing symptoms.<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c015'><sup>[364]</sup></a> <em>See Formulæ</em>

<span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> It is frequently adulterated with common resin, but
the fraud more generally committed is that of mixing with, or substituting
the inferior species for the Socotrine, but the <em>Barbadoes Aloes</em> may, independent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>of its want of aromatic flavour, be distinguished from the Socotrine
by a simple test, for the latter dissolves entirely in boiling water and alcohol,
whereas the former, when treated in a similar manner, leaves a considerable
residue; sometimes the <em>Horse Aloes</em> is made to appear so bright
and pure, as not to be easily distinguished by the eye even from the <em>Socotrine</em>,

<span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> It is a triple, or sometimes a quadruple
salt, with excess of acid, consisting of sulphuric acid and alumina, with
potass, or ammonia, or frequently both of them; the nature of the alkali
however does not in the least appear to affect the properties of alum,
although it produces a crystallographic modification; for where potass is
present the summit of the crystal will exhibit a truncation. Dr. Ure has
lately produced alum with soda, and the combination differs from common
alum only in its greater degree of solubility, a property which at once recommends
it to the attention of the pharmaceutist and physician. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span>
A fluid-ounce of cold water dissolves 30 grains, but if boiling
four drachms; it is insoluble in alcohol. <span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span>
<em>Alkalies</em> and <em>alkaline salts</em>, after neutralizing the excess of acid, precipitate
the alumine. It is also decomposed by <em>carbonate</em> and <em>muriate of ammonia</em>,
<em>carbonate of magnesia</em>, and <em>tartrate of potass</em>, by <em>lime-water</em>, <em>acetate of lead</em>, and
<em>the salts of mercury</em>, as well as by many vegetable and animal substances,
especially <em>galls</em> and <em>kino</em>. It is on this account very injudicious to combine
alum with any vegetable astringent with a view to encrease its virtues;
thus the “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulvis Sulphatis Aluminæ compositus</span></i>” of the Edinburgh college,
is less powerful than any of the ingredients of which it is composed; and
the addition of alum to the decoction of bark, undoubtedly diminishes its
efficacy as an astringent injection. <span class='sc'>Medicinal Uses.</span> Alum is internally
a powerful astringent, in hæmorrhages and inordinate fluxes, and is
externally useful for repellent and astringent lotions, gargles, and collyria.
Dioscorides and Hippocrates praised its effects as a lotion in various kinds
of ulcers, and particularly in sores of the mouth, and in spongy, swelled
gums. Van-Helmont was the first person who employed alum in uterine
hemorrhage, and the success of the practice very considerably enhanced
his reputation. <em>Boerhaave’s</em> astringent powder for the ague consisted of
<em>Alum</em> and <em>Nutmeg</em> with the addition of <em>Armenian bole</em>. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, gr. x. In
large doses it is liable to excite nausea, and to act upon the bowels. Nutmeg
or some aromatic should therefore be joined with it. <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition</span>.
In solution, or in substance made into pills with extract;
(<em>Form: 53, 56</em>,) it is sometimes given with advantage in the form of whey
(<em>Alum-whey—Serum Aluminosum</em>) made by boiling ʒij with a pint of milk,
and then straining, the dose of which is a wine glass full; (<em>Form; 54.</em>)
By briskly agitating a drachm of alum with the white of an egg, a coagulum
is formed, (<em>Alum curd of Riverius</em>; <em>Albumen. Aluminosum</em>) which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>serviceable in some species of ophthalmia, when applied between two
pieces of thin linen rag.<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c015'><sup>[365]</sup></a> As alum is not decomposed by sulphate of
lime, hard water may be safely used for its solution. It has the effect of
retarding, and in some instances of preventing, the acetous fermentation
in vegetables; thus when added to common <em>paste</em> it prevents its becoming
sour; animal substances, as <em>glue</em>, are preserved by it in a similar manner.
It has also the property of clearing turbid water, wine, and spirituous liquors,
for which purpose it is extensively employed. <span class='sc'>Officinal Preparations.</span>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Alumen Exsiccatum</span>, L. Ustum. D. <em>Dried Alum.</em> By the action of
heat alum undergoes watery fusion, yields its water of crystallization, and
loses more than one third of its weight; if the heat be too intense, or long
continued, it is deprived of a great part of its acid. It has been recommended
in doses of a scruple, in cholic, when it has been said to operate
gently upon the bowels, and to relieve the pain: I have myself experienced
this good effect when the cholic has been produced by the action of
lead: Dr. Grashuis, a Dutch Physician, first recommended its use in
Cholica Pictonum. The preparation however is principally used as an
external application, having a degree of escharotic power, which renders
it serviceable in venereal chancres, as well as in other ulcers having weak
and spongy granulations; it is also very frequently employed to destroy
fungous excrescencies, but it should be remembered that, as it owes such
power to an excess of acid, unless it be carefully prepared, it must be inefficient.

to be a <em>Sesque</em>-carbonate, composed of 3 atoms of carbonic acid, 2 atoms of
ammonia, and 2 of water; or that it is a definite compound of <em>Carbonate</em>

its weight of cold water; Mr. Phillips states four times; the mean of these

of temperature, but when dissolved in boiling water it effervesces, and undergoes
a partial decomposition; it is quite insoluble in alcohol, and hence
on the addition of spirit to a strong solution, a dense coagulum is produced.

stimulant in those gastric affections which supervene habits of irregularity
and debauchery; combined with opium it affords a powerful resource in
protracted diarrhœa attended with debility of the alimentary canal: and in
cases of muscular atony so frequently witnessed, as the <em>sequela</em> of chronic
rheumatism, ammonia, in large doses, offers the best remedy; I have
moreover witnessed the beneficial effects of this remedy in hoarseness depending
upon relaxed states of the throat. In typhus fever it has been
particularly recommended by Huxham, Pringle, and many other physicians,
and some have considered it superior to any other stimulant upon
such occasions. It is also useful in syncope and hysteria, in the form of
smelling salts;<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c015'><sup>[366]</sup></a> with respect to its application for making saline draughts,

In consequence of the present unsettled opinions respecting the nature of
muriatic acid and ammonia, and the changes which they undergo by combination
with each other, the composition of this salt is involved in some
obscurity. According to Dr. Thomson, it consists of equal volumes of
muriatic acid gas and ammoniacal gas, although he has subsequently observed
that from the peculiar properties of the substance, it may be a compound
of <em>Chlorine</em> and <em>Ammonium</em> (the hypothetical base of ammonia.)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Unlike all the other ammoniacal salts, it does not undergo decomposition by
heat. <span class='sc'>Solubility</span>, f℥j of water at 66° dissolves about two drachms and a
half; at 212° it dissolves its own weight; it is also soluble in 4½ parts of
alcohol; its solution in water is accompanied by considerable reduction of
temperature. <span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span> The sulphuric and nitric
acids unite with the ammonia, and disengage the muriatic acid, whilst
ammonia is disengaged by the action of potass and its carbonate, carbonate
of soda, lime, magnesia, &amp;c. which combine with its muriatic acid;
with oxy-muriate of mercury it combines and increases its solubility, see
<em>Hydrarg: Oxy-murias</em>. When united with acetate of lead, it decomposes
it, and a muriate of lead is precipitated. It is obvious also that nitrate of
silver, and all the metallic salts whose bases form insoluble compounds
with muriatic acid, are incompatible with it. <span class='sc'>Uses.</span> Rarely employed
as an internal remedy, externally it is employed in lotions, either for the
cold produced during its solution, in which case it should be applied as
soon as the salt is dissolved, or for the stimulus of the salt, on which principle
it acts as a powerful discutient in indolent tumours (<em>Form. 146.</em>) It
is also an ingredient in a very useful plaster, in which it undergoes chemical
decomposition; this plaster consists of <em>Soap</em> ℥j, <em>lead plaster</em>, ʒij, liquified
together, to which, when nearly cold, are added of <em>muriate of ammonia</em>
finely powdered ʒss. The alkali of the soap enters into combination
with the muriatic acid of the muriate of ammonia, and forms thereby
muriate of potass, or soda, and ammoniacal gas (on which the virtue of
the plaster depends) is slowly but abundantly liberated, acting as a powerful
stimulant and rubefacient: it should be applied immediately after it
is formed, and be renewed every twenty-four hours, otherwise the intention
is lost; (<em>Pharmacopœia Chirurgica.</em>) I have often applied this plaster
with evident advantage to the chest in pulmonary affections, and I wish
to recommend it to the attention of practitioners. It is very useful also
in that rheumatic affection of the muscles of the chest, which is so frequently
met with in persons in advanced life; during the last winter I
was consulted in two cases where the distress after exercise was so considerable
as to resemble angina pectoris. <span class='sc'>Officinal Preparations.</span>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>of the peach, and a pleasant bitter flavour. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span>
Boullay has lately confirmed the analogy which Proust had stated
to exist between the emulsion of sweet almonds and human milk, viz.
the former consists of sweet oil 54, albumen 24, sugar 6, gum 3, with
traces of acetic acid; the indigestible property of the almond depends
upon its albuminous matter. The <em>bitter almond</em>, in addition to those constituents,
contains hydro-cyanic acid, (Prussic acid,) in union with a peculiar
volatile oil, upon which its narcotic properties depend; but this deleterious
element is so modified by the natural state of combination in
which it exists with sweet oil and albumen, that they may be eaten without
inconvenience. The bitter almond has long been regarded as an antidote
to drunkenness; Plutarch states it as a fact on the authority of his
physician Claudius. Other bitters were however supposed to possess similar
powers in this respect, hence the <em>Poculum Absinthiatum</em> to which
we have before alluded. See page 79. Both sorts of almonds yield by
expression a large quantity of fixed oil, which is perfectly mild. See <em>Oleum
Amygdal</em>. The water distilled from the bitter almond, when strongly
impregnated, has been found to exert a deleterious action on the human
body, and to prove fatal to many animals. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> By trituration
with water a milky mixture is produced, (<em>an emulsion</em>), for which purpose
the sweet almonds should be previously freed from their cuticle, (<em>blanched</em>),
and this ought to be performed by infusing them in tepid water; for when
hot it separates a portion of their oil, as is evident from their being thus
rendered yellow, and the emulsion is therefore more liable to ferment, and
be decomposed. ℥ij of almonds saturate about f℥vj of water; since
however this extemporaneous preparation is tedious and inconvenient, the
London Pharmacopœia very judiciously directs a confection to be ready
prepared, ʒj of which, when triturated with f℥j of water, immediately
forms an elegant emulsion. See <em>Mistura Amygdal</em>. Almonds form a
useful intermedium for suspending in water many substances which are
of themselves not miscible with it, as camphor, and several of the gum-resins;
they also assist in the pulverization of refractory substances, as
Ipecacuan, &amp;c. <span class='sc'>Officinal Preparations.</span> <em>Confectio Amygdalarum.</em>

cold water; nor is it dissolved by alcohol or ether; although potass dissolves
starch, yet the solution of it is not disturbed by potass, carbonate of
potass, nor ammonia, but an alcoholic solution of potass produces a precipitate;
acetate of lead, and infusion of galls occasion also precipitates.
Starch is susceptible of several interesting and important changes; thus,
if it be exposed to heat until its colour becomes yellow, its properties are
so far altered that it is no longer insoluble in cold water; and according
to the experiments of Saussure, if it be mixed with water, a spontaneous
decomposition takes place, and a quantity of sugar is formed, amounting
in weight to one half of the starch employed, in addition to which a peculiar
gummy matter results, and a substance intermediate between gum
and starch, to which the name of <em>Amidine</em> has been given. Starch moreover
is convertible into saccharine matter by the agency of sulphuric acid.
<span class='sc'>Uses.</span> Being demulcent it is generally employed as a vehicle for the exhibition
of opium in the form of enema. The ordinary blue starch is coloured
by a solution of smalt and alum, and is unfit for medicinal use; formerly
it was tinged yellow with saffron or turmeric, but this went out of
fashion on the execution of the famous midwife Mrs. Collier, who was

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> This article appears in the market in conical loaves,

with propriety be applied to the pure metal. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> It is insoluble

for the preparation of the other antimonial combinations, for which
purpose it is more eligible than the metal itself, as being less contaminated
with metallic impurities. Its medicinal energies depend altogether upon
the state of the stomach, and must therefore be extremely uncertain; when
it meets with any acid in the stomach, it acts with extreme violence, a circumstance
which requires precaution. It was formerly much more employed
as an Alterative than at present. Stoll recommends its use in
chronic rheumatism, and advises its union with Myrrh. In the treatment
of affections of the skin it has been long used, both singly, and in union
with other substances, such as <em>Conium</em>, <em>Dulcamara</em>, <em>Guaiacum</em>, &amp;c. In
Scrophulous diseases, connected with cutaneous eruptions, or ulcerations,
it has been a favourite remedy with many practitioners, and it forms the
basis of several foreign <em>Nostrums</em>. In times of remote antiquity it was

to the air, the crystals slightly effloresce and become opaque; thrown

<span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> This is involved in much doubt and obscurity;
it is stated in the various dispensatories to be a triple salt, consisting of
tartaric acid, oxide of antimony,<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c015'><sup>[378]</sup></a> and potass, and which therefore, says
Mr. Thomson, on the principles of the reformed nomenclature, ought to
be termed a <em>tartrate of antimony and potass</em>. The truth of these views,
however, is extremely questionable. I am inclined to believe with Gay
Lussac, that in the various metalline compounds, of which super-tartrate
of potass is an ingredient, this latter substance acts the part of a simple
acid; an opinion which receives much support from the great solvent
property of cream of tartar, and from the striking fact that it is even capable
of dissolving various oxides which are insoluble in tartaric acid,
of which the protoxide of antimony is an example. According then to
this view, tartar emetic is a salt composed of bi-tartrate (<em>super-tartrate</em>) of
potass, which acts the part of an acid, and protoxide of antimony: from
the experiments of Mr. Phillips, it would appear that 100 parts of the bi-tartrate
will dissolve 70 of the protoxide. In this state of doubt it must
be admitted that no name can be more appropriate than <em>Antimonium Tartarizatum</em>,
and the London College have therefore properly disregarded
the suggestions which have been offered for changing its name. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span>
Much discrepancy of opinion exists upon this subject, owing probably
to the variations and incidental impurities to which the salt is liable.
Dr. Duncan, who selected very pure specimens for examination, states
that it is soluble in three times its weight of water at 212°, and in fifteen
at 60°. This solution, when the salt is pure, is perfectly clear and transparent,
but if long kept, unless a portion of spirit be added, it undergoes
decomposition; a precipitate indeed sometimes takes place very rapidly,
but this is generally tartrate of lime, an incidental impurity, derived from
the super-tartrate of potass. <span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span> <em>Mineral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Acids, Alkalies, and their Carbonates, most of the Metals, Soaps, Hydro-Sulphurets,
and many infusions and decoctions of bitter and astringent Vegetables</em>,
e. g. f℥j. of the decoction of yellow bark is capable of completely decomposing
℈j of this salt, and of rendering it inert.<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c015'><sup>[379]</sup></a> Berthollet has accordingly
recommended the immediate exhibition of this decoction when an
overdose of the salt has been taken; and Orfila has given a very satisfactory
case in which this antidote succeeded. Infusion and tincture of
galls throw down curdled and inert precipitates of a dirty white colour,
inclining to yellow. Rhubarb is equally incompatible: the extract of
this substance therefore never ought to be employed in forming pills of tartar
emetic: but it deserves notice that this salt is not decomposed by the
infusions of gentian or wormwood. The <em>Alkaline Sulphates</em>, provided they
be perfectly neutral, produce no disturbance in solutions of <em>tartar emetic</em>,
and therefore cannot be considered incompatible with them; if there be
any excess of acid, as in <em>alum</em>, <em>bi-sulphate of potass</em>, &amp;c. then its decomposition
is effected, and a white insoluble sulphate of antimony is precipitated.
It appears therefore that the famous “Emeto-purgative” of the
French school, consisting of sulphate of soda, and tartarized antimony in
solution, is by no means the unchemical mixture which some have considered
it to be, and that it really produces its effects from the operation of
its original ingredients, and not from that of the compounds (<em>Sulphate of
Antimony, Tartrate of Soda, and Sulphate of Potass</em>) which have been erroneously
supposed to result. <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span> Solution is its best
form, see <em>Liquor Antimonii Tartarizati</em>. <span class='sc'>Dose.</span> It either vomits, purges,
or sweats, according to the quantity exhibited; thus gr. 1/4 will, if the skin
be kept warm, promote a diaphoresis; gr. ½ will procure some stools first,
and sweating afterwards; and gr. j will generally vomit and then purge,
and lastly sweat the patient; in very minute doses, as gr. 1/10 or 1/12 combined
with squill and ammoniacum, it acts as an expectorant, see <em>Formulæ
1, 2, 3, 8, 60</em>. It is decidedly the most manageable, and the least uncertain
of all the antimonial preparations, and the practitioner would probably have
but little to regret, were all the other combinations of this metal discarded
from our pharmacopœias. Some authors have considered this substance
as possessing sedative powers, independent of its nauseating and diaphoretic
effects. It undoubtedly acts upon the heart, and controls the force of
the circulation in fevers, without occasioning any other sensible effect.
Mr. Brodie, after having given large doses of this salt to animals, found
that the heart beat very feebly, and although artificial respiration was
kept up, it soon ceased to act altogether. Lenthois of Montpellier advises
small doses of it in incipient phthisis, and it would on some occasions
appear to diminish the febrile excitement. The following is the form in
which Dr. Lenthois recommends it to be exhibited upon such occasions.
He directs a grain of Tartarized Antimony to be dissolved in eight table
spoonsful of distilled water, which are to be added to six or eight pints of
water, and to be taken as common drink. Tartar emetic, when triturated
with lard, in the proportion of ʒiss or ʒij to ℥j of the latter, forms a very
powerful rubefacient, occasioning a pustular eruption on the skin, and
proving very serviceable in deep-seated inflammation; or the application
may be made by dusting a piece of adhesive plaster with tartarized antimony,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>taking care to leave a margin untouched that it may more firmly
adhere. Dr. Jenner, in a late Essay on the influence of artificial eruptions
on certain diseases, recommends the following formula for such a
purpose.—℞. <em>Antimonii Tartarizati</em> (<em>in pulverem subtilem trit.</em>) ʒij—<em>Unguenti
Cetacei</em> ʒix;—<em>Sacchari albi</em><a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c015'><sup>[380]</sup></a> ʒj;—<em>Hydrargyri Sulphureti Rubri</em> gr.
v. M. ut fiat Unguentum. The Pustules which are produced by the inunction
have been generally compared to variolous pustules, they are, however,
in general much smaller, not so red at the base, nor so tense and
white when fully suppurated. They are very painful. In Hooping cough,
frictions with this ointment upon the region of the stomach have been
greatly extolled. By this application, says Dr. Jenner, we can not only
create vesicles, but we can do more,—we have at our command an application
which will at the same time both vesicate and produce diseased
action on the skin itself, by deeply deranging its structure beneath the
surface. This is probably one cause why the sympathetic affection excited
by the use of Cantharides, and those changes produced by Tartar
Emetic are very different. The eruption should be kept up for some
time, either by the re-application of small portions of the diluted tartaremetic
ointment, to the affected part, or by other gently stimulating ointments.
Should they become much irritated and very painful, a soft bread
and milk poultice will in general afford relief, without interfering with the
progress of the eruption. <span class='sc'>Officinal Preparations.</span> gr. j. is contained

precipitate, dissolving with facility in pure nitric acid, with lime water. If
the crystals deliquesce, the presence of other salts may be inferred. <em>M.
Sexullas</em>, in a memoir of which there is a copious extract in the <em>Journal de
Pharmacie</em> for 1821, has shewn that all the antimonial preparations used
in medicine, except carefully crystallized <em>Tartar Emetic</em>, contain more or
less arsenic, which metal was originally combined with the antimony in
the ore, and has continued pertinaciously associated with it through all its
modifications.</p>

    <div>AQUA. <em>Water.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Water, from its extensive powers as a solvent, never occurs in a state
of absolute purity, although the nature and degree of its contamination
must necessarily vary according to circumstances and situation. It is generally
found holding earthy matter in a state of mechanical suspension,
or saline and other bodies in chemical solution. The usual varieties of
common water are classed and defined by Celsus; and modern chemists
have not found any reason to reject the arrangement. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua levissima
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>pluvialis est; deinde fontana, tum ex flumine, tum ex puteo; posthæc ex nive,
aut glacie; gravior his ex lacu; gravissima ex palude.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <span class='sc'>Rain Water.</span> <em>Aqua Pluvialis</em>, when collected in the open fields, is
certainly the purest natural water, and consequently of the least specific
gravity; the bodies which it holds in solution are, carbonic acid, a minute
portion of carbonate of lime, with traces of muriate of lime. <span class='sc'>Dew</span> is
said to be water saturated with air. Rain water ought, however, to be
boiled and strained whenever it is collected near large towns; Hippocrates
gives this advice, and M. Margraaf of Berlin has shewn the wisdom of
the precaution by a satisfactory series of experiments.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <span class='sc'>Spring Water.</span> <em>Aqua Fontana</em>, in addition to the substances detected
in rain water, generally contains a small portion of muriate of soda,
and frequently other salts; but the larger springs are purer than smaller
ones, and those which occur in primitive countries, and in siliceous rocks,
or beds of gravel, necessarily contain the least impregnation. An important
practical distinction has been founded upon the fact, that the water of
some springs dissolves soap, whilst that of others decomposes, and curdles
it; the former has been termed <em>soft</em>, the latter <em>hard</em> water; soft water
is a more powerful solvent of all vegetable matters, and is consequently
to be preferred for domestic as well as medicinal purposes; the brewer
knows well from experience how much more readily and copiously <em>soft</em>
water will dissolve the extractive matter of his malt. Horses by an instinctive
sagacity always prefer soft water, and when by necessity or inattention
they are confined to that which is <em>hard</em>, their coats become rough
and ill-conditioned, and they are frequently attacked with the gripes. Pigeons
also refuse hard water when they have been accustomed to that
which is soft.<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c015'><sup>[382]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>3. <span class='sc'>River Water.</span> <em>Aqua ex Flumine</em>, being derived from the conflux
of numerous springs and rain water, generally possesses considerable purity;
that the proportion of its saline ingredients should be small, is easily
explained by the precipitation which must necessarily take place from the
union of different solutions; it is, however, liable to hold in suspension
particles of earthy matter, which impair its transparency, and sometimes
its salubrity; this is particularly observed of the Seine, the Ganges, and
the Nile.<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c015'><sup>[383]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>4. <span class='sc'>Well Water.</span> <em>Aqua ex Puteo</em>, is essentially the same as spring
water, being derived from the same source; it is, however, more liable to
impurity from its stagnation, or slow infiltration;<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c015'><sup>[384]</sup></a> hence our old wells
furnish much purer water than those which are more recent, as the soluble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>particles are gradually washed away. Mr. Dalton observes that the
more any spring is drawn from, the <em>softer</em> the water becomes.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. <span class='sc'>Snow Water.</span> <em>Aqua ex Nive</em>, has been supposed<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c015'><sup>[385]</sup></a> to be unwholesome,
and in particular to produce bronchocele, from the prevalence of
that disease in the Alps, but it does not appear upon what principle its insalubrity
can depend; the prejudice however is a very ancient one, for
Hippocrates observes that snow or ice water is unwholesome, in consequence
of its finer particles being evaporated and lost during its solution:
it appears to differ only from rain water in being destitute of air, to which
water is certainly indebted for its briskness, and perhaps for many of its
good effects upon animals and vegetables. The same observations apply
to <em>Ice Water</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. <span class='sc'>Lake Water.</span> <em>Aqua ex Lacu</em>, is a collection of rain, spring, and
river waters, contaminated with various animal and vegetable bodies,
which from its stagnant nature have undergone putrefaction in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. <span class='sc'>Marsh Water.</span> <em>Aqua ex Palude</em> being the most stagnant is the
most impure of all water, and is generally loaded with decomposing vegetable
matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>To what extent the impurities of water are capable of influencing its
salubrity, has been a subject of interesting inquiry from the age of Hippocrates
to the present day. To many of these natural contaminations,
too much importance has been certainly attached; it is an affected refinement
to suppose that the presence of minute portions of such earthy and
calcareous salts, as generally occur in solution, can impart any noxious
quality to water;<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c015'><sup>[386]</sup></a> whilst on the contrary, animal and vegetable impurities,
or earthy bodies in a state of mechanical suspension, cannot fail to
prove injurious, and must be regarded as the true “<span class='fss'>SCELERA AQUARUM</span>.”
Guided by false analogies many have supposed that they recognised the
origin of all calcareous diseases in the earthy impurities of water; the
researches however of chemistry have removed this delusion, by demonstrating
that the substances found in water never enter into the composition
of urinary calculi.<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c015'><sup>[387]</sup></a> Metallic and other accidental contaminations
are necessarily highly injurious, and the water in which their presence is
suspected, should be submitted to the most careful examination.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>For the purification and preservation of water numerous methods have
been adopted; the mechanical impurities may be removed by filtration,
which is performed through porous stones, or alternate layers of sand or
charcoal; muddy water may be also cleared by adding a few grains of
alum to each pint,<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c015'><sup>[388]</sup></a> and in that proportion, the water is not rendered in the
least disagreeable: when water has contracted a putrid smell, it may be
rendered sweet by agitating it with a small portion of magnesia, or with
black oxide of manganese, in the proportion of 1½ parts to 250 parts of
water. Dr. Black observes that nitrate of silver, which is one of the most
antiseptic substances known, will preserve water from putrefaction for
ever, and that it may at any time be separated therefrom in a few minutes
by adding a small lump of common salt; this fact in itself is curious, but
the experiment is too hazardous to be recommended. Dr. Alston prefers
lime, as a preservative of the water, and proposes to remove it by the addition
of a carbonate of magnesia; Dr. Henry has however found that it
is more economically precipitated by the introduction of a current of carbonic
acid into the cask. As that peculiar property of water which is
termed <em>hardness</em>, generally depends upon the presence of <em>sulphate of lime</em>,
the addition of an alkaline carbonate twenty-four hours previous to its
being used, will be found to restore it, or if it should depend upon <em>supercarbonate
of lime</em>, long ebullition without any addition will be found sufficient
for its cure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Water when kept for a long time in casks, especially on long voyages,
is partially decomposed, and a volume of carburetted hydrogen is evolved,<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c015'><sup>[389]</sup></a>
imparting to such water the peculiar smell and taste which characterise
it; this decomposition may in a great degree be obviated by charring the
interior of the water casks; it is, however, prevented in the Navy by substituting
iron tanks for wooden vessels. In Pharmacy it ought to be remembered
that whenever common water is employed it should not be
<em>hard</em>; filtered rainwater maybe recommended as the most eligible on
such occasions.</p>

common water will remain mixed with the product of the process, and
uselessly add to its bulk, or even in some cases produce in it chemical
changes; unless however under such circumstances, common water purified
by filtration should be ordered, as the air which it contains imparts to
it a pleasant and sprightly flavour. In making infusions or decoctions, it
is very important that the water should be free from those impurities
which impart to it <em>hardness</em>, and which render it a far less powerful solvent
of vegetable matter, nor indeed can resinous substances be mixed with

    <div>AQUA MARINA. Sea Water.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Until the late able researches of Dr. Murray, we possessed but an imperfect
knowledge of the composition of sea water; it is not therefore surprising
that the analysis performed by different chemists should be found
to be so materially at variance; the true cause of such discordance is now
easily understood, for it appears, that in the examination of a mineral
water or any compound saline solution, the substances obtained from it
are not necessarily the original ingredients, but frequently the products of
new combinations established by the operation of analysis, and that consequently
the nature of the result obtained may vary according to the
modes in which such analysis has been conducted, or even according to
the degree of dilution in which the saline substances exist.<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c015'><sup>[390]</sup></a> The elements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>of the salts contained in a pint of sea water are <em>Lime</em> 2·9, <em>Magnesia</em>
14·8, <em>Soda</em> 96·3, <em>Sulphuric Acid</em> 14·4, <em>Muriatic Acid</em> 97·7, total 226·1
grains, and supposing these elements to be combined in the modes which
Dr. Murray’s views appear to establish, the saline contents of a pint of sea
water may be expressed as follows, <em>Muriate of Soda</em> 159·3, <em>Muriate of
Magnesia</em> 35·5, <em>Muriate of Lime</em> 5·7, <em>Sulphate of Soda</em> 25·6 grains, total
226·1 grains; besides such saline contents, it is contaminated with various
animal and vegetable bodies, in consequence of which it becomes, when
long kept, highly offensive; it ought also to be stated that Dr. Wollaston
has discovered the presence of a minute proportion of potass in sea water;
and Dr. Marcet has more lately detected ammonia in combination with
muriatic acid. <span class='sc'>Medicinal Use.</span> As a cathartic, a pint is the ordinary
quantity, which should be taken in the morning, at two doses, with an interval
of half an hour between each; this quantity contains half an ounce
of purgative salt, of which about three-fourths are muriate of soda, but it
is much more active than a similar portion of any artificial combination.
In procuring sea water for medicinal purposes, there is a precaution, the
importance of which experience has suggested to me, that it be not hastily
drank on the beach, before the particles of sand, with which under such
circumstances it is generally mixed, are allowed to subside; from the
neglect of this precaution I have witnessed serious consequences. The
most important advantages of sea water are derived from its external use
as a bath.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are waters impregnated with the essential oils of vegetables, and
are principally designed as grateful vehicles for the exhibition of more active
remedies; ample directions for preparing them are given in the several
Pharmacopœias, and if they be rectified by redistillation they may be
kept for several years; the usual mode of preserving them is by adding
spirit, which has also the incidental advantage of preventing them from
being frozen during the winter season. Some recommend a film of the essential
oil to be diffused over the water’s surface. They may be extemporaneously
prepared by adding to water what have been called <em>Essences</em>,
which consist of essential oil and alcohol, or by rubbing any essential oil
with ten times its weight of sugar, or, what answers still better, of magnesia:
when however they are so prepared they never retain their transparency.
The college, in the present Pharmacopœia, have directed the

    <div>AQUÆ MINERALES. Mineral Waters.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Although all waters that flow from the earth, are, as they contain mineral
bodies in solution, strictly speaking, <em>mineral</em> waters, yet this term is
conventionally applied to such only as are distinguished from spring, lake,
river, or other water, by a peculiarity in colour, taste, smell, or any obvious
properties, or by the medicinal effects which they produce, or are known
to be capable of producing.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the medical practitioner the history of these waters is most interesting
and instructive, involving highly important subjects of chemical and
physiological inquiry. These waters are without doubt indebted for their
medicinal virtues to the operation of the substances which they hold dissolved,
but this is so materially aided by the peculiar state of dilution in
which they exist, as well as by the mere bulk and temperature of the water
itself, as to render extremely doubtful the success of every attempt to
concentrate their powers by evaporation. To what extent dilution may
modify the chemical condition of saline solutions has been satisfactorily
demonstrated by the researches of Dr. Murray (see <em>Aqua Marina</em>), and
to what degree an increase in the solubility of any remedy may influence
its medicinal properties has been considered at some length in the first
part of this work, (<em>page 172</em>.) It is certain that, in general, soluble salts
are capable of exerting a much more powerful effect upon the animal
economy, than those which are insoluble; on which account, the earthy
muriates, especially that of lime, are amongst the most active ingredients
of mineral waters. Although chemical analysis has frequently from its
own imperfection failed in ascertaining their presence, it seems probable
that <em>muriate of lime</em> and <em>sulphate of soda</em> exist in all those springs that furnish,
by the usual methods of examination, <em>sulphate of lime</em> and <em>muriate of
soda</em>; for the same reasons it is equally probable that iron, which in certain
waters has been supposed from the analysis to exist as a <em>carbonate</em>, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>in its native solution a true <em>muriate</em>; this is undoubtedly the fact with respect
to the Bath waters. Is it then surprising, that medical practitioners
should hitherto have failed in their attempts to emulate, by artificial arrangements,
the medical efficacy of active and mineral springs? For the
investigation of the true composition of mineral waters the researches of
Dr. Murray furnish a simple and elegant formula. <em>Determine by precipitants
the weight of the acids and bases, suppose them united in such a manner
that they shall form the most soluble salts, and these salts will constitute the true
saline constituents of the water under examination.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Mineral Waters admit of being divided into four classes, viz.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <span class='sc'>Acidulous</span>; owing their properties chiefly to carbonic acid; they
are tonic and diuretic, and in large doses produce a transient exhilaration;
the most celebrated are <em>Pyrmont</em>, <em>Seltzer</em>, <em>Spa</em>, <em>Carlsbad</em>, and <em>Scarborough</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <span class='sc'>Chalybeate</span>; containing iron in the form of <em>sulphate</em>, <em>carbonate</em>, or
<em>muriate</em>;<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c015'><sup>[391]</sup></a> they have a styptic, inky taste: <em>Hartfell</em> near <em>Moffat</em>, <em>Peterhead</em>,
<em>Tunbridge</em>, <em>Brighton</em>, <em>Cheltenham</em>, <em>Bath</em>, <em>Lemington Priors</em>, <em>Castle
Horneck</em>, near <em>Penzance</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <span class='sc'>Sulphureous Waters</span> derive their character from sulphuretted hydrogen,
either uncombined, or united with lime, or an alkali: <em>Engien</em>, <em>Aix
la Chapelle</em>, <em>Harrowgate</em>, <em>Moffat</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <span class='sc'>Saline</span>; mostly purgative, and are advantageously employed in
those hypochondriacal and visceral diseases that require continued, and
moderate relaxation of the bowels; <em>Cheltenham</em>, <em>Leamington</em>, <em>Seidlitz</em>, and
all brackish waters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some springs, as those of <em>Bath</em>, <em>Matlock</em>, and <em>Buxton</em>, owe their virtues
rather to temperature than to any other cause, and others, as <em>Malvern</em>, to
the diluent power of the water.</p>

medicines which were simultaneously administered. It possesses a
bitter taste, and it has been said to act like vegetable bitters upon the digestive

useful as an external application, and may be considered as the
strongest and most manageable caustic that we possess;<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c015'><sup>[396]</sup></a> whilst in solution

also forms an excellent lotion to excite the weak granulations of fungous
ulcers. It is, moreover, said to be highly useful as an injection in cases of

drunk with impunity. This circumstance alone, would of necessity
render nitrate of silver a very uncertain remedy; and yet it is evident
that the basis of this salt is occasionally absorbed, for there are several
cases upon record, in which the oxyd of silver has been deposited in
the rete mucosum, and given a purple hue of a very singular appearance
to the patient; I have lately witnessed an instance of this kind in a lady
who had taken large doses of the nitrate, for the purpose of curing a dyspeptic
complaint; and several other similar cases stand recorded in different
works.</p>

fracture, and when reduced to powder, bearing some resemblance
to white sugar; <em>Taste</em>, acrid and corrosive, but not in any degree corresponding
with its virulence, leaving an impression of sweetness. <em>Specific
gravity</em> 3·7; it is volatilized at the temperature of 383° <em>Fah:</em> and by a
strong heat is vitrified into a transparent glass capable of crystallizing in
tetrahedra with truncated angles, or rather in octohedra. In the state of
vapour it is quite inodorous, although it is asserted in many chemical
works of authority to yield a smell like that of garlic; the fact is that the
alliaceous or garlic-like smell is wholly confined to <em>metallic</em> arsenic in a
state of vapour, and whenever the arsenious acid seems to yield this odour,
we may infer that its decomposition has taken place; this happens when
it is projected upon ignited charcoal, or when heated in contact with those
metallic bodies which readily unite with oxygen, as <em>Antimony</em> and <em>Tin</em>.
It is stated by Orfila and other chemists, that if it be projected upon heated
copper the alliaceous odour is evolved. This assertion is undoubtedly
true, but the fact requires to be explained with more precision, or we may
fall into an important error respecting it. The phenomenon takes place
only when the copper is in a state of ignition, at which temperature its
affinity for oxygen enables it to reduce the arsenious acid; for I find by
experiment that if a few grains of this substance be heated on a plate of
copper, by means of a spirit lamp or blow-pipe, no odour is perceptible, for
the whole of the acid is dissipated before the copper can acquire a sufficiently
exalted temperature to deoxidize it. If the arsenious acid be heated
on a plate of zinc, the smell is not evolved until the metal is in the
state of fusion; if instead of these metals we employ in our experiments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>those of gold, silver, or platinum, no alliaceous smell whatever is produced,
at any temperature. It however deserves particular notice, that the flame
of the spirit lamp is itself capable of decomposing the oxyd, in consequence
of the operation of its hydrogen: a fact which is very likely to betray the
chemist into the fallacious belief that the oxyd does yield the odour in
question.<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c015'><sup>[399]</sup></a> It is probable that arsenical vapours which yield this peculiar
odour are less noxious than those which are inodorous, but I am not
aware that the knowledge of this fact can be applied to any purpose of
practical importance.<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c015'><sup>[400]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> This substance possesses
many of the essential habitudes of an acid, as for instance, that of
combining with the pure alkalies to saturation; it is therefore very properly
denominated <em>Arsenious Acid</em>. It may be farther acidified by distilling
it with nitrous acid, and the compound which results is a white concrete
substance termed <em>Arsenic Acid</em>; from experiments on the quantity of oxygen
absorbed by metallic arsenic, during its conversion into these two
compounds, instituted by Proust and Davy, it appears that the <em>arsenious</em>
acid consists of about 25 of oxygen and 75 of metal, and the <em>arsenic</em> acid
of 33 of oxygen and 67 of metal; or, the quantity of metal being the
same, that the oxygen in the latter compound is to that in the former nearly
as three to two. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> We have but lately been set right
upon this point; Klaproth has shewn that it requires for its solution 400
parts of water at 60° and only 13 at 212°, and moreover, that if 100 parts
of water be boiled on the arsenious acid, and suffered to cool, it will retain
three grains in solution, and deposit the remainder in tetrahedral crystals;
this fact shews the importance of employing boiling water in every chemical
examination of substances supposed to contain arsenic. It is soluble
in alcohol and oils, the former taking up two per cent.; with lime
water it produces a white precipitate of <em>arsenite of lime</em>, which is soluble
in an excess of arsenious acid; with magnesia it forms a soluble <em>arsenite</em>,
which proves very virulent. The poisonous effects of arsenious acid are
so amply detailed in medical works,<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c015'><sup>[401]</sup></a> that it would be superfluous to dwell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>upon them in this place; it may however be interesting and useful to record
an account of the pernicious influence of arsenical fumes upon organized
beings, as I have been enabled to ascertain in the copper smelting
works, and tin burning-houses of Cornwall. This influence is very apparent
in the condition both of the animals and vegetables in the vicinity;
horses and cows commonly lose their hoofs, and the latter are often to be
seen in the neighbouring pastures crawling on their knees, and not unfrequently
suffering from a cancerous affection in their rumps, whilst the
milch cows, in addition to these miseries, are soon deprived of their milk;
the men employed in the works are more healthy than we could <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</span></i>
have supposed possible; the antidote upon which they all rely with confidence,
whenever they are infested with more than an ordinary portion of
arsenical vapour, is <em>sweet oil</em>, and an annual sum is allowed by the proprietors
in order that it may be constantly supplied; this opinion is not solitary,
for Tachenius relates that the poisonous effects, such as convulsions,
gripes, and bloody stools, with which he was seized from exposure to the
fumes of arsenic, were relieved by milk and oil.</p>

<p class='c007'>It deserves notice that the smelters are occasionally affected with a
cancerous disease in the scrotum, similar to that which infests chimney-sweepers,
and it is singular that Stahl in describing the putrescent tendency
in the bodies of those who die from this poison, mentions in particular
the gangrenous appearance of these parts. It is a very extraordinary
fact that previous to the establishment of the copper works in Cornwall,
the marshes in their vicinity were continually exciting intermittent fever,
whereas since that period a case of ague has not occurred in the neighbourhood;
I have heard it remarked by the men in the works, that the
smoke <em>kills</em> all fevers. The fact is here stated without any other comment
than that the agricultural improvements which have taken place in
the district, are not sufficient to afford any clue to the explanation of the
circumstance. <span class='sc'>Medicinal Uses.</span> Much has been said upon this subject,
and the propriety and safety of its exhibition has been often questioned;
there can be no doubt but that the greatest circumspection is required
in the practitioner who administers it, and it ought not, in my opinion,
to be employed until other remedies have failed; that it is capable
of accumulating in the system is very evident, and this, in certain habits,
may predispose the patient to serious diseases; the form in which it is
most manageable and least dangerous, is that of solution. See <em>Liquor
Arsenicalis</em>. Some practitioners have exhibited it in substance, made into
pills, by rubbing one grain with ten of sugar, and then beating the mixture
with a sufficient quantity of crumb of bread to form ten pills, one of
which is a dose. The Chinese and other oriental nations form the sulphuret
of arsenic (<em>realgar</em>) into medical cups, and use lemon juice, after it
has stood some hours in them, by way of cathartic. As an external application,
arsenic has long been extolled in the cure of cancers; the caustic
so extensively used under the sanction of the late Mr. Justamond in cases of
open cancer, consisted of two parts of Antimony, and one of Arsenious acid,
fluxed together in a crucible, and afterwards levigated, and reduced to the
requisite degree of mildness by the addition of powdered Opium.<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c015'><sup>[402]</sup></a> But it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>deserves notice in this place, that repeated experiments have proved that
arsenic kills<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c015'><sup>[403]</sup></a> more rapidly when applied externally to an abraded part,
than when internally administered. See page 132. <em>Lionardo di Capoa</em>
relates the case of a child killed by the violent vomiting and purging
arising from a slight wound made in the head by a comb, wet with oil, in
which Arsenic had been infused for the purpose of killing vermin; and
we have numerous instances on record, where the application of arsenical
cerates and ointments has been followed by violent and dangerous
symptoms. We also learn from the different historians of the Plague of
London, that the arsenical amulets which were worn, as preservatives, on
that occasion, were sometimes attended with deleterious consequences;
<em>Crato</em> (Epist. 168.) observed an ulcer of the breast produced by them.
<em>Vernascha</em>, violent pains and syncope. Amongst the foreign authors who
have related cases of poisoning by the external application of Arsenic
we may mention <em>Desgranges</em> (<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recueil Period: de la Société<a id='t298'></a> de Med: de
Paris</span></cite>, T. vi. p. 22.) who records the history of a chambermaid, poisoned
by having rubbed her head with an arsenical ointment for the purpose of
destroying vermin; and <em>Roux</em> (<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouveaux Elemens de Med: Operat. par. J.
P. Roux</span></cite>,) who confessed to have killed a young girl of eighteen by an application
of the “<em>Pate Arsenicale</em>” to a cancerous breast. To the Empirics
of our own times we are indebted for many fatal illustrations of the
subject. Since the last edition of this work, a Lady applied to a well
known Quack, distinguished for his impudent pretensions in the treatment
of cancer, and submitted to a caustic application to the breast. In
a short time paralysis ensued, and the application was discovered to contain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>a large proportion of Arsenic, and that the disease, for the cure of
which it had been applied, was <em>not</em> cancer. A somewhat analogous case
occurred under the care of a bold empiric in the neighbourhood of St.
George’s Fields, who undertook to remove the deformity of bow legs in a
dandy drawing-master! by <em>rasping the shin bones</em>, and applying arsenic to
the surface of the wound; in consequence of which, in addition to extensive
local mischief, the unhappy dupe became paralytic. It is also necessary
to inform the practitioner that Arsenious acid has been known to
produce poisonous effects when applied to the <em>unbroken</em> skin; a case of
this nature is related by Desgranges, in the sixth volume of the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recueil Periodique
de la Soc: de Med</span></cite>: another may be found in the 22d volume of the
<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta Germanica</span></cite> (1730); and Renault obtained similar results in his experiments
on animals. When the system is under the influence of arsenic,
the following symptoms will appear, viz. thickness, redness, and stiffness
of the palpebræ, soreness of the gums, ptyalism, itching over the surface
of the body, restlessness, cough, pain in the stomach and bowels, head-ache,
and I have also occasionally noticed paucity of urine, and even
stranguary, a fact of which I find no mention in other authors. Strange
as it may appear, <em>Arsenic</em> has been inhaled, together with the vapours of
frankincense, myrrh, and those of other gums during a paroxysm of asthma!
This extraordinary practice arose from the practitioner mistaking
the gum juniper, or <em>Vernix</em> of the Arabians, which by their medical authors
was prescribed in fumigations under the name of <em>Sandarach</em>, for the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σανδαρακη</span> of Aristotle, which was a sulphured of arsenic.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> It is frequently sophisticated with chalk, gypsum, or
sulphate of barytes; the fraud is instantly detected by its not being entirely
volatilized by heat, or by any insoluble residuum occurring in preparing
the <em>Liquor Arsenicalis</em>, according to the directions of the pharmacopœia.
To many the adulteration of so active a substance may seem unimportant,
but in consequence of its being thus rendered a medicine of variable activity,
it is one of the most dangerous frauds which can be committed; a
very unpleasant circumstance lately occurred from such a cause in one of
our public institutions: arsenic had been obtained from the shop of a respectable
chemist, who had not usually supplied the establishment, for the
purpose of preparing the arsenical solution: the article happened to be less
adulterated than that which had been previously employed; the solution
however was prepared in the usual way, and the usual dose was continued,
when the patients were soon seized with violent pains in the bowels,
and the cause was not detected until by an examination of the bottle the
usual sediment was not discovered.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Antidotes.</span> Late researches have shewn that <em>sulphuret of potass</em>, on
which physicians have placed so much reliance, merits no confidence.
The great indication to be fulfilled in all cases of poisoning is to excite vomiting,
and to administer liquids which are the least liable to act as solvents
of the acrid matter, on which account lime water presents itself as a
very appropriate fluid. The subject, however, is very fully considered in
the first part of this work, to which I am very desirous of directing the attention
of the medical practitioner; see <em>Antidotes</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>By its reduction to a metallic state.</em> Mix a portion of the suspected
powder with three times its weight of <em>black flux</em>;<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c015'><sup>[404]</sup></a> put the mixture into a
thin glass tube, hermetically closed<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c015'><sup>[405]</sup></a> at one end, about eight inches in
length, and one-fourth of an inch in diameter; should any of the powder
adhere to the sides of the tube, it must be carefully brushed off with a feather,
so that the inner surface of its upper part may be perfectly clean and
dry; the closed end of the tube, by way of security, may be thinly coated
with a mixture of pipe-clay and sand,<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c015'><sup>[406]</sup></a> but this operation is not absolutely
necessary; the open extremity is to be loosely plugged with a piece of
paper; the coated end must be now heated on a chaffing dish of red hot
coals, when the arsenic, if present, will sublime, and be found lining with
a brilliant metallic crust the upper part of the tube; a portion of this reduced
metal, if it be arsenic, will, when laid on heated iron, exhale in dense
fumes, which are characterised by a strong smell of garlic. Mr. Phillips
has lately stated that the tube may be sufficiently heated, for the purpose
of metallization, by means of a spirit lamp.<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c015'><sup>[407]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It merits particular notice, that in reducing by the above process the arsenious
acid to the state of metal, the presence of potass in the flux is very
essential, since it forms immediately an <em>arsenite of potass</em>, and thereby fixes
the arsenious acid, and prevents it from being volatilized before the temperature
is sufficiently high to enable the charcoal to decompose it; an
ignorance of this fact has not unfrequently proved a source of disappointment
and fallacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another method of identifying <em>white arsenic</em> by metallization, is to form
at the moment of its reduction, an alloy with copper, which is easily effected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>in the following manner,—Mix the suspected powder with black
flux, as in the former experiment, and place the mixture between two polished
plates of copper, bind them tight together by iron wire, and expose
them to a low read heat; if the included substance contained arsenic, a
silvery white stain will be left on the surface of the copper, which is an alloy
of the two metals. If in this, as in the former experiment, charcoal be
employed without the addition of a fixed alkali, the result may, for the
same reason, prove unsatisfactory. But, with whatever care this experiment
is conducted, it is, to say the least, a clumsy and unsatisfactory test,
and ought never to be relied upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>By the application of certain Reagents, or Tests, to its Solutions.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>A great and important question has arisen in medical jurisprudence,
whether any chemical proof of the presence of <em>white arsenic</em>, short of its
actual reduction to the state of metal, can be depended upon, or ought to
be received as evidence in the courts of criminal law. After a full experimental
investigation of the subject, and an impartial review of all the facts
which bear upon the question, I feel no hesitation in declaring it to be my
conviction, that <em>white arsenic may be detected without any fear of fallacy</em>, <em>by a
proper application of certain tests</em>, and that the contrary opinion is entirely
founded in error, and unsupported by experiment, as will more fully appear
in the sequel.<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c015'><sup>[408]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(A) <em>Fused Nitrate of Silver</em>, or <em>Lunar Caustic</em>—For this test we are indebted
to Mr. Hume of London, who first gave it to the public in the Philosophical
Magazine for May 1809, vol. xxxiii. His method of applying
it is as follows: into a clean Florence flask introduce two or three grains
of the suspected powder, to which add about eight ounces of rain or distilled
water, and heat the solution until it begins to boil, then while it boils
frequently shake the flask, and add to the hot solution a grain or two of
sub-carbonate of potass, agitating the whole to make the mixture uniform.
Pour into a wine glass about two table spoonsful of the solution, and touch
the surface of the fluid with a stick of lunar caustic. If arsenic be present,
a beautiful yellow precipitate will instantly proceed from the point of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>contact, and settle towards the bottom of the glass as a flocculent and copious
precipitate.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this test the 60th part of a grain may be satisfactorily recognised in
two ounces of water. The presence of some alkali is essential to the success
of the experiment, since arsenious acid is unable, by the operation of
simple affinity, to decompose the nitrate of silver.<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c015'><sup>[409]</sup></a> The validity of this
test has been questioned on the following grounds, which shall be fairly
examined in order.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Objection 1.</span> <em>The alkaline phosphates are found to produce precipitates
with silver, analogous in colour and appearance to the arsenite of silver.</em> This
is undoubtedly the case when the experiment is performed in the manner
just stated, but there are other reagents which will immediately distinguish
these bodies, as will be seen under the history of the <em>Ammoniuret of silver</em>;
I have also shewn that there is a mode of so modifying the application of
the silver test itself, that no error or doubt can arise in the use of it from
the presence of phosphoric salts.<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c015'><sup>[410]</sup></a> My method consists in conducting the
trial on writing paper, instead of in glasses, thus—drop the suspected fluid
on a piece of white paper, making with it a broad line; along this line a
stick of lunar caustic is to be slowly drawn several times successively,
when a streak is produced of a colour resembling that known by the name
of <em>Indian Yellow</em>; and this is equally produced by the presence of arsenic
and that of an alkaline phosphate,<a id='t302'></a> but the one from arsenic is rough, curdy,
and flocculent, as if effected by a crayon, that from a phosphate homogeneous
and uniform, resembling a water-colour laid smoothly on with a
brush; but a most important and distinctive peculiarity soon succeeds, for
in less than two minutes the phosphoric yellow fades into a <em>sad green</em>, and
becomes gradually darker, and ultimately quite black; while, on the other
hand, the arsenical yellow remains permanent, or nearly so, for some time,
when it becomes brown. In performing this experiment the sun-shine
should be avoided, or the transitions of the colour will take place too rapidly.
It would be prudent also for the inexperienced operator to perform
a similar experiment on a fluid known to contain arsenic, and on another
with a phosphoric salt, as a standard of comparison. In this way the
nitrate of silver, without the intervention of any other test, is fully capable
of removing every ambiguity, and of furnishing a distinguishing mark of
difference between the chemical action of arsenic and that of the phosphates.
Mr. Hume states that he has repeated this experiment to his
entire satisfaction,<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c015'><sup>[411]</sup></a> and that, in a late unfortunate case of poisoning, he
derived considerable information by its application. The laborious author
of the London Dispensatory accepts it as an excellent test, but observes
that it is rendered more luminous by brushing the streak lightly over with
liquid ammonia immediately after the application of the caustic, when,
if the arsenic be present, a bright queen’s yellow is produced which remains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>permanent for nearly an hour; but that when the lunar caustic
produces a white-yellow before the ammonia is applied, we may infer the
presence of some alkaline phosphate, rather than that of arsenic. One
of the great advantages of this test is the very small quantity that is required
for examination; it would be well therefore for the operator to perform
the experiment in both ways on a separate paper.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Objection 2.</span> <em>The Muriates produce precipitates with silver so copious
and flocculent as to overcome every indication which the presence of arsenic would
otherwise afford.</em> Dr. Marcet proposes to obviate this difficulty, by adding
to the fluid to be examined dilute nitric acid, and then cautiously applying
the nitrate of silver until the precipitation ceases; in this way the muriatic
acid will be entirely removed, whilst the arsenic, if it be present, will
remain in solution, and may be rendered evident by the affusion of ammonia,
which will instantly produce the yellow precipitate in its characteristic
form. This mode however it must be confessed appears complicated,
and requires some chemical address for its accomplishment; it should
be also known that the yellow precipitate thus produced is not always
permanent, for it is soluble in the nitrate of ammonia formed during the
process. Under these circumstances, it is surely preferable to precipitate
at once from the suspected fluid all the substances which nitrate of silver
can effect, and then to expose the mixed and ambiguous precipitate so
obtained, to a low heat in a glass tube, when the arsenious acid will be
immediately separated by sublimation. In this way the presence of muriates
may even in certain cases be serviceable, especially if the quantity
of arsenic be minute; for by increasing the bulk of the precipitate we
shall decrease the difficulty of its examination. By this process, also, I
should propose to meet the embarrassments which arise from the influence
of various animal and vegetable substances, as milk, broth, wine, &amp;c. so
frequently present in the suspected liquid, and which are known to alter the
character of the arsenical indications. In this case, however, we must not
rely upon any single precipitant; after having thrown down all that is
precipitable by the silver test, the supernatant liquid should be decanted,
slightly acidified by acetic acid, and submitted to the action of Sulphuretted
Hydrogen; when, should any precipitate occur, it must be separated
and added to the former. Dr. Christison has demonstrated the importance
of this proceeding by shewing that the precipitates, occasioned by the
Ammoniurets of silver and copper, are soluble in certain vegetable infusions.<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c015'><sup>[412]</sup></a>
M. Orfila proposes to remove the difficulties and embarrassments,
occasioned by the colouring matter of different media, by the application
of <em>Chlorine</em>, so as to change the colour to a shade that will not offer any
optical impediment to the characteristic indications of the different tests.
I am ready to admit that such a mode of proceeding may, on certain occasions,
assist the accomplished chemist in his analysis, but in the hands
of a person less accustomed to chemical manipulation, I hesitate not to declare
that it is subject to fatal fallacies;<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c015'><sup>[413]</sup></a> whereas, by precipitating the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>whole, and submitting the precipitate to the process of sublimation, we
shall avoid every source of error. Why then should we attempt to pursue
our game through the windings of a labyrinth, when a direct road lies before
us, by which we may at once drive it into the open plain? Mr. Phillips
has recently proposed the addition of animal charcoal (<em>Ivory Black</em>)
for the purpose of destroying the colouring matter. He found that by
mixing this substance with the <em>Liquor Arsenicalis</em>, that the colouring matter
was so completely destroyed in a few minutes, that the test of nitrate of
silver, or any other might be readily applied. This experiment was repeated
with Port wine, gravy soup, and a strong infusion of onions, and
he succeeded in these cases in procuring a solution sufficiently colourless
for the application of the most delicate reagents. It might be supposed,
adds Mr. Phillips, that the Phosphoric acid which the animal charcoal
contains, might have some share in the production of the yellow precipitate
with silver; he found, however, that water, or wine, which was
merely digested on the animal charcoal, produced no effect with the nitrate
of silver, except a slight precipitate of chloride; and this even, was prevented
by lixiviation. I have, however, a serious objection to offer to this
proposal. Animal charcoal, by some mode of operation not understood,
possesses the property of removing certain substances from their solution
in water; I have already noticed this effect with respect to Lime water,
(see p. 247, <em>note</em>), and I have lately found that it takes place with very dilute
solutions of Arsenic.<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c015'><sup>[414]</sup></a> Hence charcoal, as we shall presently find,
may be employed for the purpose of detecting minute portions of arsenic.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Objection 3.</span> <em>Chromate of potass produces, with Nitrate of Silver, a yellow
precipitate which, when placed side by side with one produced by Arsenious
acid, cannot be distinguished by colour or appearance from it</em>. This fact has
lately been announced by Dr. Porter of the University of South Carolina.
(Silliman’s Journal, iii, 355.) But as the presence of chromate of potass
can never be suspected in any research after arsenic, in cases of forensic
interest, the fact is of no importance to the physician.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the Arsenious acid is mixed with vegetable matter, and it becomes
difficult to separate it by filtration, the whole may be evaporated to
dryness, taking great care that the heat applied for such a purpose never
exceeds 250° <em>Fah:</em> or we shall lose the arsenic by volatilization. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>residue thus obtained may then be submitted to a higher temperature, in
a subliming vessel, in order to procure the arsenious acid in its pure state.
Should the arsenious acid have, in the first instance, been dissolved in oil,
Dr. Ure proposes to boil the solution in distilled water, and to separate the
oil afterwards by the capillary action of wick threads. If the arsenious
acid be mixed with resinous bodies, oil of turpentine may be employed as
their solvent, which will leave the arsenic untouched. Dr. Black directed
the application of alcohol for this purpose, but this is obviously improper,
since arsenious acid is soluble in that fluid.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been stated that, in consequence of the inability of arsenious acid
to decompose nitrate of silver by simple elective attraction, the presence of
an alkali becomes indispensable in the examination, for which purpose Dr.
Marcet has suggested the superior advantages which will attend the use
of ammonia, in cases where the arsenic has not been previously combined
with a fixed alkali, since it does not, when added singly, decompose nitrate
of silver; a circumstance which in using the fixed alkalies is very liable
to occasion fallacy. This led Mr. Hume to improve his original plan, by
forming at once a compound, which he calls the <em>Ammoniaco-nitrate of silver</em>,
but which may with more propriety be designated as an <em>Ammoniuret</em>.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c015'><sup>[415]</sup></a>
This is a triumph in the art of analysis; for whilst it obviates the necessity
of ascertaining the exact proportion of alkali required in each experiment,<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c015'><sup>[416]</sup></a>
it possesses the valuable property of not in the least disturbing the phosphate
of soda.</p>

<p class='c007'>(B.) <em>Sulphate of Copper.</em> Like the preceding test, this also requires,
for its success, that the arsenious acid should be combined with some alkali,
in which case, by the operation of double elective attraction, an arsenite
of copper is thrown down of a very striking and characteristic colour,
being that of the well-known pigment called <em>Scheele’s green</em>; if arsenic
be not present in the liquid so assayed, and a fixed alkali has been employed,
the result will be a delicate <em>sky-blue</em>, instead of the <em>grass-green</em>
precipitate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Hume avails himself also of the peculiar property of ammonia to
form a metallic salt, and has employed it with copper: he takes the sulphate
or acetate of that metal, and by the same process as that described
for the preparation of an ammoniuret of silver, forms another test. In
using this, however, care must be taken that it be not too highly concentrated,
for in that state it will not produce precipitation. Much controversy
has taken place on the subject of sulphate of copper as a test for
arsenic, and it has been stated, with more confidence than truth, that a
<em>decoction of onions</em> has the property of imparting to the copper precipitate,
which is produced by a fixed alkali, a colour and appearance analogous
to that which is occasioned by arsenic. This opinion was boldly advanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>and supported on a most important<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c015'><sup>[417]</sup></a> trial at the Lent assizes for
Cornwall in 1817. Since this event an opportunity<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c015'><sup>[418]</sup></a> has occurred which
has enabled me to examine this alleged fact, by a fair and appropriate
series of experiments, the result of which satisfactorily proved that the
opinion was grounded on an optical fallacy, arising from the <em>blue</em> precipitate
assuming a <em>green</em> colour, in consequence of having been viewed
through a yellow medium.<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c015'><sup>[419]</sup></a> The phosphoric salts may also, under similar
circumstances, be mistaken for arsenic, for the intense blue colour of
the phosphate of copper will thus necessarily appear green. This instance
of optical fallacy is not solitary, for <em>corrosive sublimate</em> has been
said to possess the character of an alkali, because it turns the syrup of
violets green, whereas this change is to be attributed solely to the combination
of the yellow hue of the sublimate with the blue colour of the
violet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whenever therefore such a source of fallacy can be suspected, the operator
would do well to repeat his experiment on white paper, in the manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>I have before proposed, and the results which are obtained in glasses
should always be examined by day-light, and viewed by reflected and not
by transmitted light. The presence of Peroxide of Iron in the Cupreous
salt will also impart a green colour to the precipitate produced by an
alkali. To obviate any fallacy which might arise from this circumstance,
Mr. Phillips proposes to add some pure Potass to the sulphate of
copper; if pure, a fine blue precipitate will be thus obtained; to this
may be then added the suspected solution, and if Arsenious acid be present,
it will then convert this blue precipitate to a green one.</p>

<p class='c007'>(C.) <em>Sulphuretted Hydrogen.</em> This is a very delicate test for arsenic,
producing with its solution a beautiful golden coloured liquor, which after a
short time lets fall a precipitate. Mr. Phillips,<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c015'><sup>[420]</sup></a> in reviewing the third
edition of the present work, has stated, that no such precipitate occurs, but
I find that in close, as well as in vessels exposed to the air, it takes place
by repose. By this reagent, so small a quantity as <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>000,000</span></span><a id='t307'></a> may be detected
in solution; and it may be also stated in farther proof of the utility
of this test, that it is less affected than any other by the presence of animal
or vegetable matter. The method of preparing a solution of sulphuretted
hydrogen gas is extremely simple. Put into an oil flask about two
ounces of undiluted muriatic acid and an ounce and a half of powdered
Sulphuret of Antimony; fit a cork to the flask and pass through it the
short leg of a small glass tube twice bent at right angles; pass the longer
leg of the tube into a phial containing distilled water, and then by the
heat of a spirit lamp applied to the flask, sulphuretted hydrogen gas will
be abundantly liberated, and though much of it will escape, yet a sufficient
quantity will be dissolved by the water. The annexed sketch represents
the apparatus proposed by Mr. Phillips, and which will require
but little practical skill, either for its construction or use.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illo_307.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'>But it is not always necessary to prepare a watery solution of Sulphuretted
Hydrogen, a stream of the gas, introduced into the suspected liquor
by means of the above apparatus, will act with equal delicacy, and possesses,
as Dr. Christison has observed, the advantage of not diluting it.
Before applying this test, it is necessary to add an acid, if any alkali should
exist along with the Arsenic, otherwise no precipitate will take place.</p>

<p class='c007'>(D.) <em>Alkaline Hydro-sulphurets.</em> These bodies do not affect the arsenious
solution, unless a few drops of acetic acid be added. To the <em>Hydro-sulphuret</em>,
or perhaps more properly, <em>Hydroguretted Sulphuret</em>, of Ammonia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>there is an insuperable objection, since this fluid, when diluted, possesses
the colour which we expect to produce by the action of Sulphuretted Hydrogen
upon Arsenious Acid.</p>

<p class='c007'>(E.) <em>Charcoal Powder.</em> This test was proposed by Mr. A. Thomson,
(London Dispensatory, 2nd edition, p. 53.) Into the suspected solution
stir a moderate quantity of charcoal powder, allow it to settle, then pour
off the supernatant liquor, and when the powder which remains is dry,
sprinkle some of it on a red hot poker, when, if the solution should contain
Arsenic, the odour of Garlic will be rendered sensible. I have already
offered some remarks upon the cause of this phenomenon (<em>page 304</em>.)</p>

<p class='c007'>There are several other tests by which arsenic may be identified. The
process described in the Dublin Pharmacopœia for the preparation of <em>Arsenias
Kali</em>, the arseniate, or rather super-arseniate of potass, which has
been long known under the name of “the arsenical salt of Macquer,” has
been strongly advised as a collateral proof; it consists in decomposing the
nitrate of potass<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c015'><sup>[421]</sup></a> by the arsenious acid, but since this problem requires
that the suspected poison should be in a solid and palpable form, it is impossible
to examine its pretensions to our confidence, without being reminded
of the story so often told to us in our infancy, of catching a bird
by laying salt upon its tail.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is necessary to observe in this place, that the <em>arseniate</em>, like the <em>arsenite
of potass</em>, or that of <em>ammonia</em>, is obedient to the silver test, but that instead
of the yellow precipitate which is produced by the latter salt, we obtain,
by the former, a red or brick-coloured one.</p>

<p class='c007'>If arsenious acid and quick-lime be heated together in a glass tube, a
sudden ignition is occasioned at a certain temperature, when metallic arsenic
will sublime, and an arseniate of lime be formed. In this case one
portion of the arsenious acid is robbed of its oxygen to complete the acidification
of the remainder.</p>

<p class='c007'>In taking an impartial review of all the evidence which the investigation
of this subject can furnish, it must appear to the most fastidious, that
the silver and copper test above described are capable, under proper management,
of furnishing striking and infallible indications, and that in
most cases they will be equally conclusive, and in some even more satisfactory
in their results, than the metallic reproduction upon which such
stress has been laid, and for this obvious reason, that unless the quantity
of metal be considerable,<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c015'><sup>[422]</sup></a> its metallic splendour and appearance is often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>very ambiguous and questionable. It has to my knowledge happened to
a medical person, by no means deficient in chemical address, to ascribe to
the presence of arsenic that which was no other than a film of very finely
divided charcoal: in this state of doubt the last resource was to ascertain
whether it yielded, or not, upon being heated, an alliaceous odour. Surely
an unprejudiced judge would prefer the evidence of sight, as furnished
by the arsenical tests, to that of smell, as afforded in the last experiment.
No one will attempt to deny that it is the duty of the medical practitioner
who is called upon to decide so important a question as the presence of
arsenic, to prosecute by experiment every point which admits the least
doubt; he should also remember that in a criminal case, he has not only
to satisfy his own conscience, but that he is bound, as far as he is able, to
convince the public mind of the accuracy and truth of his researches;
and he fails in his duty if he omits, through any false principle of humanity,
to express the strong conviction which the success of his experiments
must necessarily have produced in his mind. Let it however be remembered,
that the application of chemical reagents on solutions suspected to
contain arsenic, so far from throwing any obstacle in the way of the metallic
reduction of that body, are the very steps which should be adopted
as preparatory to the “<em>experimentum crucis</em>,” since the precipitates which
are thus produced may be collected, and easily decomposed, as before stated.

these subjects are referred to the second volume of our work on “<em>Medical
Jurisprudence</em>.” <em>Tit: Poisons.</em></p>

It has been recommended in glandular swellings, gleets, schirrus of the

since, however, it becomes black from the operation of Sulphuretted Hydrogen
and its compounds,<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c015'><sup>[430]</sup></a> much inconvenience attends its application.
Its medicinal powers appear to have been first noticed by Jacobi,<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c015'><sup>[431]</sup></a> but the
remedy attracted little or no attention until the publication of a paper
upon the subject by Odier<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c015'><sup>[432]</sup></a> of Geneva. The diseases in which its powers
as a tonic have been more particularly displayed, are Gastrodynia, Pyrosis,
and Dyspepsia attended with cholic. Dr. Marcet in a paper read in
1801 before the Medico-chirurgical Society of London, says, “I have had
frequent opportunities of trying the oxide of Bismuth in spasmodic affections
of the stomach in Guy’s Hospital, and those trials have fully confirmed
the opinion which I formerly gave of the utility of this medicine.”
The practitioner will receive a further confirmation of its value by referring
to Dr. Bradsley’s Medical Reports: and Dr. Yeats has published in the

When triturated with water two-thirds of its substance are speedily
dissolved, and a turbid solution results; alcohol dissolves nine-tenths,
and forms a yellow transparent tincture, which is rendered turbid by the
addition of water; sulphuric ether dissolves six-tenths of the substance;
it is also soluble in alkaline solutions, and the resulting compound is not
rendered turbid by water, but is instantly decomposed by acids, and the
precipitate so produced is of an extremely brilliant yellow colour, and
soluble in an excess of acid. <span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span> No bodies
appear to produce in gamboge such a chemical change as to destroy
the chemical properties which distinguish it, but by a mechanical admixture,
its solubility and consequently its operation, may be materially

its too rapid solubility, and sudden impression upon the stomach, might
be obviated by diminishing the dose, and repeating it at short intervals as

time the atmosphere be rather moist, for the reason stated in page
175. It is readily ignited, and burns with a brilliant flame and much
smoke; it melts at 288°, and boils at 400. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span>
It is a proximate vegetable principle, resembling the essential oils in many
of its habitudes, and probably differs from them in composition only in
containing a larger proportion of carbon. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> Water may be
said to dissolve about a nine hundredth part of its weight, or f℥j rather
more than gr. ½, but its solvent power is considerably increased by the
addition of carbonic acid gas; camphor is also rendered more soluble by
trituration with magnesia; it is soluble in an equal weight of alcohol,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>but it is again separated by the addition of water; it is also dissolved by
oils, both fixed and volatile,<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c015'><sup>[439]</sup></a> especially if their temperature be a little
raised, and by sulphuric and other æthers, but strong acetic acid may be
said to be its most powerful solvent. By repeatedly distilling it with nitric
acid it is converted into <em>Camphoric acid</em>, an acid distinguished by peculiar
properties, and composing, with alkalies and earths, a class of
salts called <em>Camphorates</em>, but which do not possess any medicinal value.
The alkalies do not produce any effect upon camphor. <span class='sc'>Incompatible
Substances.</span> It is not affected by any substance with which we can
combine it. <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span> It is preferable in the form of mixture,
since it is very liable in the solid state to excite nausea, and, from
swimming on the contents of the stomach, to occasion pain at its upper orifice.
If a larger dose be required than that which water can dissolve, an
additional proportion may be suspended by means of sugar, almonds, yelk
of egg, or mucilage, for which purpose three times its weight of gum arabic
is required. If Camphor be first dissolved by trituration in a very
small portion of oil, it readily mixes with mucilage of gum arabic, and
may then be conveniently blended with liquids. It has also the property
of uniting with gum-resins, and of converting them into permanently soft,
and uniform masses; hence they may sometimes be conveniently applied
for diffusing it in water. It may be formed into pill-masses by stiff mucilage,
fœtid gums, or by a confection. <span class='sc'>Medicinal Uses.</span> In moderate
doses it exhilarates, without raising the pulse, and gives a tendency to
diaphoresis; and under certain conditions of the body, when opium fails,
it will frequently promote sleep. As its effects are transient, its dose
should be repeated at short intervals. <em>Illustrative Formulæ</em> 1, 6, 21, 125,

    <div class='c004'><em>Blistering, or Spanish Flies.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This beautiful insect of the beetle tribe is exceedingly abundant in the
southern parts of Europe, and particularly in Spain. They are collected
from the leaves of the different trees on which they delight to dwell, in
June and July, and are afterwards destroyed, as recommended by Dioscorides,
by the fumes of strong vinegar, and dried in the sun. The chemical
history of Cantharides is still involved in some obscurity; the blistering
principle has been obtained by Robiquet in a separate state, when it
assumes the form of small crystalline plates, having a micaceous lustre,
not unlike spermaceti; Dr. Thomson has given to it the name of <em>Cantharidin</em>;<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c015'><sup>[441]</sup></a>
when pure, it is insoluble in water and in cold alcohol; boiling alcohol,
however, dissolves it, but precipitates it again on being cooled.
Æther and the oils dissolve it readily. Although not soluble in water it
is rendered so by the presence of a yellow matter which exists in native
combination with it. A very minute portion of this substance dissolved
in sweet oil, and applied to the skin with a piece of paper, produces vesication
in five or six hours. In addition to this active principle, Cantharides
contain a green concrete oil; a yellow fluid oil; a peculiar black substance
soluble in water and proof spirit, but not in pure alcohol; a saponaceous
or yellow substance, soluble both in water and alcohol; Uric
acid; Acetic acid; Phosphate of Magnesia, and a parenchymatous substance.<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c015'><sup>[442]</sup></a>
<span class='sc'>Medicinal Uses.</span> Cantharides, when administered internally,
are powerfully stimulant and diuretic;<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c015'><sup>[443]</sup></a> and whether applied as a vesicatory
to the skin, or taken into the stomach, they have a peculiar tendency
to act upon the urinary organs, and especially to irritate and inflame the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>neck of the bladder, and occasion strangury. On this account they have
been very successfully employed both for the cure of incontinence of urine,
and suppression of this discharge, from torpor or paralysis of the bladder;
they have also been used in gleet and leucorrhæa, and in cases of seminal
weakness and impotence. In consulting the works of Dioscorides,
Galen, and Pliny, we shall find they entertained a notion, that the <em>virus</em>
existed only in the body of the fly, and that the head, feet and wings,
contained its antidote! Hippocrates prescribed them internally in Dropsy,
Jaundice, and Amenorrhœa; and yet in the end of the sixteenth
century, Dr. Groenvelt was charged and sued<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c015'><sup>[444]</sup></a> for giving them inwardly,
in substance, for the cure of the stone. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, in substance,
not exceeding gr. i, combined with opium or hyoscyamus. See <em>Tinctura:
Cantharid</em>. A strong decoction of the Cantharides in Oil of Turpentine
furnishes a most powerful Epispastic, and may be easily applied by
means of dossils of lint. As the general belief, which exists with respect
to the aphrodisiac powers of this substance, may induce persons to try its
efficacy in large doses, either for goading the exertions of exhausted nature,
or for incensing the passions of females whose seduction is meditated,
it behoves the medical practitioner to become acquainted with the
symptoms which it may produce, and of which the following may be
considered as the most prominent;—violent retching; copious alvine evacuations,
frequently bloody; very severe colics; active inflammation of
the stomach and intestines; sometimes universal convulsions, attended
with a horror of liquids, resembling that which occurs in hydrophobia;
furious delirium, &amp;c. But the affections of the urinary passages, and organs
of generation, may be regarded <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατεξοχην</span>, as the peculiar symptoms
of poisoning by Cantharides; such as heat in the bladder, bloody micturition,
horrible strangury, painful and obstinate priapism, <em>satyriasis</em>, &amp;c.
The method of treatment to be pursued on such occasions will consist in
copious bleeding, warm bath, local fomentations, mild and mucilaginous
drinks; and opium, especially in the form of clyster or suppository.

mucilages, oils, and of matter in which <em>extractive</em> abounds; and some medicines
are said to be even deprived of their characteristic odour by remaining
in contact with it, as Valerian, Galbanum, Balsam of Peru, and
Musk. The use of charring the interior of water casks, and of wrapping
charcoal in cloths that have acquired a bad smell, depends upon this property;
for the same reason it furnishes a very excellent tooth powder,<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c015'><sup>[448]</sup></a>

<p class='c007'>Cloves are the unexpanded flowers, or flower-buds, of the clove tree,
which are first obtained when the tree is six years old; they are gathered
in October and November before they open, and when they are still green;
and are dried in the sun, after having been exposed to smoke at a heat of
120°, till they assume a brown hue. It is a curious fact that the flowers
when fully developed are quite inodorous, and that the real fruit is not in
the least aromatic. <span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> <em>Form</em>, that of a nail, consisting of a

the bee melted with boiling water, pressed through cloth bags, and ultimately
cast into round cakes for the market. Whether it be an animal
product, or a vegetable substance merely collected by the bee, has been a
question of dispute; the former opinion is probably correct, although wax
is certainly produced as a secretion by many plants. The yellow wax
contains a portion of pollen which imparts its colour to it, and increases
its fusibility. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> It is insoluble in water, and in cold alcohol
or ether, but it is soluble in boiling alcohol and ether, in fixed oils, and in
alkalies. <span class='sc'>Uses.</span> It is chiefly employed in the composition of external
applications. <span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> <em>Earth</em> or <em>peas-meal</em> may be suspected
when the cake is very brittle, and the colour inclines to grey; <em>Resin</em> is detected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>by putting it in cold alcohol, which will dissolve the resinous part
without acting on the wax. <em>Tallow</em> is discovered by the greater softness

<p class='c007'>These compositions are characterized by a degree of consistence, intermediate

Unguentum Calaminare. D.—These preparations have been long known
under the name of <em>Turner’s Cerate</em>; they form the basis of many extemporaneous
cerates, in some of which nitric oxide of mercury, in the proportion
of ʒj of the oxide to ℥j of cerate, and in others, the liquor of sub-acetate
of lead, are introduced. By the former combination we obtain a
very useful application to indolent and ill-conditioned ulcers, a valuable stimulant
for inducing an action conducive to the regeneration of parts. By
the latter combination we derive a remedy highly extolled by our most experienced
surgeons, in the cure of burns and scalds.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Ceratum Cantharidis.</span> L. The basis of this preparation is spermaceti

the same cases as the former cerate; the camphor which enters into its
composition imparts a gently stimulating power to it; it proves extremely
serviceable in chronic opthalmia of the tarsus, and for the increased secretion
of tears, which so frequently affects the eyes of persons advanced in

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Ceratum Sabinæ.</span> L. <em>Savine Cerate.</em> It is intended to keep up a
purulent discharge from a blistered surface; in practice however it is often
found to fail from the difficulty of obtaining it good, since the acrid principle
of the plant is injured by long boiling, and by being previously dried;
the ointment also loses its virtue by exposure to the air.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Ceratum Saponis.</span> L. This preparation was much used and recommended
by the late Mr. Pott; in preparing it the greatest possible caution
is required; the fire should never be too rapidly applied, the stirring should
be uniform and incessant, and the heat should only be sufficient to keep
the two compositions liquid at the time when they are united. The original
intention of the cerate was to afford, when spread upon linen, a
mechanical support to fractured limbs, and to keep the points of the bone
in due apposition, while in consequence of the <em>acetate of lead</em> which is formed
in the first stage of the process for its preparation, it possesses the virtues
of a saturnine dressing. As a mechanical agent it may prove at
once effectual and dangerous, for if it be applied before all inflammation
and swelling have entirely disappeared, the inflamed vessels may be completely
strangulated by its unrelenting pressure, and high erysipelatous
inflammation, and a rapid state of gangrene may be the result.</p>

Under the trivial name <em>officinalis</em>, Linnæus confounded no less than four
distinct species of cinchona, and under the same denomination the British
Pharmacopœias, for a long period, placed as varieties the three barks
known in the shops; this error indeed is still maintained in the Dublin
Pharmacopœias, but the London and Edinburgh colleges have at length
adopted the arrangement of Mutis, a celebrated botanist, who has resided
in South America, and held the official situation of Director of the exportation
of bark for nearly forty years.</p>

the same, although they differ in intensity. They are all bitter, sub-astringent
and aromatic, but the flavour of the <em>Yellow</em> bark is incomparably
the most bitter, although less austere and astringent, whilst the red bark
has a taste much less bitter, but more austere and nauseous than either of
the other species. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> Few vegetable substances
have been more frequently, or more ably submitted to chemical analysis
than the Peruvian bark, and yet but few results of any great practical
utility had been obtained previous to the recent experiments of Pelletier
and Caventou, communicated to the Academy of Sciences at Paris, since
the publication of the fourth edition of the present work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Maton<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c015'><sup>[460]</sup></a> had several years ago observed, that an infusion of nutgalls
produced a precipitate with the decoctions of Bark; a fact which
necessarily produced considerable speculation. Seguin was induced to
regard it as arising from the presence of <em>gelatine</em>, (<em>see p. 56</em>,) an opinion
which Dr. Duncan proved to be erroneous, and shewed that it depended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>upon a new proximate principle, to which M. Gomez of Lisbon had previously
assigned the name of <em>Cinchonine</em>. Besides which, bark was considered
as containing resin, extractive, gluten, tannin, a small portion of
volatile oil, and some salts with a base of lime; one of which however
had been only found in <em>Yellow</em> bark, and had been discovered to contain a
peculiar vegetable acid, denominated by Vauquelin <em>Kinic</em>, a name which
Dr. Duncan very judiciously superseded by that of <em>Cinchonic</em> acid.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the <em>Red</em> bark, Fourcroy detected also a portion of citric acid, some
muriate of ammonia, and muriate of lime. Upon which of these principles
the tonic and febrifuge virtues of bark depends, has ever proved a
fruitful source of controversy. Deschamps attributed them to <em>Cinchonate
of Lime</em>, and asserted that two doses of thirty-six grains each, would cure
any intermittent. Westering considered <em>Tannin</em> as the active constituent;
while M. Seguin assigned all the virtues to the principle which precipitates
gallic acid, and which, as it has been before stated, he mistook for
gelatine. Fabroni concluded from his experiments, that the febrifuge
power of the bark did not belong exclusively and essentially to the astringent,
bitter, or to any other individual principle, since the quantity of
these would necessarily be increased by long boiling, whereas the virtues
of the bark are notoriously diminished by protracted ebullition. This argument
however will not go far, when we consider the chemical changes
which the liquid is known to suffer during that operation, and by which
a considerable portion of its matter is rendered insoluble. Such was the
state of our knowledge respecting the composition of the <em>Cinchona</em>, when
Pelletier and Caventou, guided by analogy, were led to infer the presence
of an alkaline element of activity in its composition. The merit, belonging
to the researches of these eminent chemists, does not so much consist
in the discovery of new elements, as in the proofs which they have furnished
of the well known principle, <em>Cinchonine</em>, being a salifiable base,<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c015'><sup>[461]</sup></a>
and in demonstrating the peculiar states of combination in which it exists

following characters and habitudes.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is white, transparent, and crystallizes in the form of needles; it has
but little taste, circumstance depending upon its comparative insolubility,
as it requires no less than 7000 parts of cold water for its solution; in
boiling water it is soluble in 2500 times its weight, but a considerable part
separates, on cooling. In alcohol and the acids it is much more soluble,
and imparts to such menstrua the characteristic bitter of the bark; it dissolves
only in small quantities in the fixed and volatile oils, or in sulphuric
ether. Cinchonia restores the colour of litmus which has been reddened
by an acid. With acids it combines and forms neutral salts, of which the
solubility and crystalline form vary with the acid employed.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Sulphate of Cinchonia</em>, easily crystallizable and moderately soluble, has
been found to consist of <em>Cinchonia</em> 100, <em>Sulphuric acid</em> 13·02.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Nitrate of Cinchonia</em>, uncrystallizable, and sparingly soluble.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Muriate of Cinchonia</em>, crystallizes in very beautiful needles, and is more
soluble than the preceding salts.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Oxalate of Cinchonia</em>, nearly insoluble; hence by pouring oxalic acid,
or oxalate of ammonia into solutions of any of the soluble salts of cinchonia,
we obtain a very white and abundant precipitate, which might
be mistaken for oxalate of lime; it is however soluble in an excess of
acid, and in alcohol.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Gallate of Cinchonia</em>, equally as insoluble as the <em>Oxalate</em>, whence the
precipitate occasioned by pouring an infusion of galls into the decoctions
of genuine cinchona.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cinchonia, when heated, does not fuse before decomposition. Its ultimate
elements are <em>oxygen</em>, <em>hydrogen</em>, and <em>carbon</em>; the latter being predominant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Kinic acid</em>, which exists in native combination with the <em>Cinchonia</em>,
amongst several other peculiar properties, is convertible by means of heat
into a substance (<em>acide pyrokinique</em>,) which is crystallizable, and capable
of producing with iron a most beautiful green colour.</p>

    <div>2. <em>Cinchona Cordifolia.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the <em>Yellow Bark</em>, these chemists discovered also a salifiable base,
quite distinct however in its character and habitudes from <em>Cinchonia</em>;
they accordingly have designated it by another name, viz. <em>Quinine</em>, but
which we shall hereafter call <em>Quina</em>. In speaking of these two bases, the
authors compare them, in point of dissimilarity, to the fixed alkalies, potass
and soda. <em>Quina</em> is distinguished from <em>Cinchonia</em> by the following characters.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>It cannot, like this latter body, be crystallized by evaporation
from its alcoholic solution, although it may be obtained in transparent
plates. <em>It is very soluble in æther</em>; in water it is as insoluble as cinchonia,
but its taste is much more bitter. The salts which it forms are different
from those of cinchonia, both in the proportion of their elements, and in
the properties which they possess, being generally much more bitter. In
comparing their composition, <em>Quina</em> will appear to have less capacity of
saturation<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c015'><sup>[464]</sup></a> than cinchonia.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Sulphate of Quina.</em> It forms crystals quite remarkable for their satin-like
and pearly lustre. It is soluble in cold water, a property which is
very considerably increased by an excess of acid.<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c015'><sup>[465]</sup></a> It appears from the
observations of M. Callaude, apothecary<a id='t333'></a> at Annecy, that <em>Sulphate of Quina</em>
exposed to a gentle heat, becomes highly luminous; and M. Pelletier has
since found that <em>Sulphate of Cinchonia</em>, when exposed in a capsule to the
steam of boiling water, exhibits the same phenomenon, but that neither
<em>Quina</em> nor <em>Cinchonia</em>, by themselves, nor their acetates, possess this phosphorescent
quality. This appears to be the most efficient of all the salts
of Bark, and is the one from which I have frequently derived much advantage.
In its exhibition we must be careful not to combine it with substances
that form insoluble compounds with it. The <em>Infusum Rosæ compositum</em>
is objectionable as a vehicle, on account of the astringent matter
which it contains, and which therefore precipitates the <em>Quina</em> from its solution.
I have lately seen a prescription, in which the salt is directed to
be rubbed with a few grains of <em>Cream of Tartar</em>, and then to be dissolved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>in mint water. This is obviously injudicious, since Tartaric acid decomposes
the sulphate, and occasions an insoluble <em>Tartrate</em>, which is precipitated.
The form in which I have usually prescribed it is in that of solution,
with a small quantity of sulphuric acid, in the proportion of a
minim to every grain of the salt. A <em>Wine of Quina</em> may be made by
adding five grains of the sulphate to a pint of Sherry; a Tincture, by dissolving
the same quantity in eight fluid-ounces of Rectified Spirit. The
sulphate is to be preferred to the pure <em>Quina</em> in these cases, because, when
the tincture is made by using the alkali, not saturated by an acid, a precipitate
is formed on adding it to aqueous liquors. Dose of the Sulphate,
gr. i.–v.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Acetate of Quina</em>, very remarkable for the great facility with which it
crystallizes, and for the pearly aspect and agreeable stellated grouping of
the crystals; whereas the acetate of cinchonia crystallizes with difficulty,
and simply in plates transparent, and devoid of lustre.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Quina</em> forms with the oxalic, gallic and tartaric acids, salts as insoluble
as those which the same acids form with <em>Cinchonia</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Red Bark</em> upon analysis was found to contain a double basis, and
to yield both <em>Cinchonia</em> and <em>Quina</em>, and, what is still more extraordinary,
the quantity of each exceeded that which is known to exist in the <em>grey</em>
and yellow <em>barks</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The latest experiments, however, made on very large quantities of the
bark, have shewn that <em>Quina</em> and <em>Cinchonia</em> exist simultaneously in all the
three species; but the <em>Cinchonia</em> is, relatively to the <em>Quina</em>, in greater
quantity in the <em>grey</em> bark; whilst, in the <em>yellow</em> bark, the <em>Quina</em> so predominates,
that the presence of the <em>Cinchonia</em> might well have escaped notice
when small quantities were operated on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having thus furnished a sketch of this curious discovery, we have next
to enquire whether the alkaline bases in question do actually concentrate
all the virtues of the barks in which they reside? M. Majendie<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c015'><sup>[466]</sup></a> informs
us that Pelletier had very early after the discovery transmitted to him a
portion of the new substances for trial, and that he has unequivocally determined
that they do not possess any deleterious qualities,<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c015'><sup>[467]</sup></a> and are
therefore essentially different from the principles of <em>Nux vomica</em>, (<em>Strychnine</em>,)
Opium, (<em>Morphia</em>,) &amp;c. According to the testimony of Dr. Double, as related
in the same journal, they would seem to possess the medicinal properties
of the cinchona.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the third number of <em>Majendie’s Journal</em> we receive a report from M.
le docteur Renauldin, of an intermittent cured by the <em>Sulphate of Cinchonia</em>,
in doses of six grains.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the discovery of an alkaline element in Opium led the way to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>detection of salifiable bases in other active vegetables,<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c015'><sup>[468]</sup></a> it has seemed to
me preferable that I should introduce those general observations which I
wish to offer upon the subject of those bodies, under the history of that
narcotic. It is only necessary in this place to caution the practitioner
against the hasty generalizations of the too sanguine chemist; it has already
been observed that those vegetable remedies, whose value has been
established by the sober experience of ages, consist of different principles
of activity, or, at least, owe a modified power to the compound effect of
their several ingredients. (<em>p. 154, note.</em>)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Solubility of the Bark.</span><a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c015'><sup>[469]</sup></a> Cold water extracts its bitter taste, with
some share of its odour; when assisted by a moderate heat, the infusion
is stronger, but becomes turbid as it cools; the infusion cannot be kept,
even for a short time, without undergoing decomposition, and being spoiled;
wine also extracts the virtues of bark, and is prevented by this substance
from becoming sour, a fact which probably depends upon the avidity
with which some of the principles of bark combine with oxygen,
and which may throw some light upon the cause of its antiseptic virtues.
The colouring matter of wine is precipitated by bark, as it is by charcoal,
in the course of a few days. By decoction the active matter of cinchona
is in a great degree extracted, but if the process be protracted beyond eight
or ten minutes, it undergoes a very important chemical change, the precise
nature of which is not well understood; the balance of affinities,
however, by which the different elements are united, is evidently overthrown,
and a considerable precipitation ensues; oxygen would also appear
to have been absorbed; whether the <em>Cinchonia</em> becomes insoluble
has not yet been ascertained, but experience has shewn that the general
loss of solubility, produced by such a process, is accompanied with a corresponding
loss of medicinal activity; on which account, the extract is
necessarily a very inefficient preparation; if we attempt to redissolve it,
not more than one half is soluble in water. Vinegar is a less powerful
solvent than water; the active matter of bark is rendered more soluble
by the addition of mineral acids, and by the earths and alkalies; these
latter bodies deepen its colour, and precipitate the <em>Cinchonia</em>, for which
reason, when they are employed, the decoction ought not to be filtered;
see <em>Form. 41, 42</em>, and note thereon. <em>Lime water</em> has been recommended
as a solvent, and it affords an excellent form for children and dyspeptic
patients; for the same reason we obtain a stronger and perhaps a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>efficient preparation, by triturating it with magnesia, previous to the process
of infusion. Alcohol is a very powerful solvent, but the great activity
of this menstruum so limits its dose that we are prevented from exhibiting
a sufficient quantity of the bark in the form of tincture; it furnishes however
an excellent adjunct to other preparations.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span> Precipitates are produced by the <em>salts
of iron</em>, <em>sulphate of zinc</em>, <em>nitrate of silver</em>, <em>oxy-muriate of mercury</em>, <em>tartarized antimony</em>,
<em>solutions of arsenic</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em> Any considerable portion of a tincture
produces also a precipitation, which sometimes does not immediately take
place, and the medicinal value of the bark is probably not impaired by it.
As the infusions of <em>nut galls</em> and some other vegetable astringents precipitate
the cinchonia from bark, it becomes a question how far such liquids
are medicinally compatible; saline additions, as <em>alum</em>, <em>muriate of ammonia</em>,
<em>&amp;c.</em> have been frequently proposed, but in many such mixtures decompositions
arise which must deceive us with regard to the expected effects.
<span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span> No form is so efficient as that of powder, a fact
which would seem to argue against the <em>exclusive</em> value of the <em>Cinchonia</em>;
even the ligneous fibre which the chemist pronounces to be inert and useless,
may produce its share of benefit by modifying the solubility of the
other ingredients, or by performing some mechanical duty which we are
at present unable to understand or appreciate; but where the stomach rejects
it, it must be administered in <em>infusion</em> or <em>decoction</em>, with the addition
of its <em>tincture</em>. In cases where it is necessary to join cordials, an infusion
of bark in Port wine<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c015'><sup>[470]</sup></a> is a popular and very useful form for its administration.

period it has been generally used in diseases of debility, in fevers of the
typhoid type, and in gangrene. It was first conjectured to be useful in
gout by Sydenham, and Dr. Haygarth has strongly recommended its exhibition
in acute rheumatism; when however it is used in these diseases,
the greatest attention ought to be paid to the state of the bowels, and purgatives
should be occasionally interposed. In Dyspepsia, the use of the
purer bitters is to be greatly preferred to that of the bark. <span class='sc'>Officinal

The frauds committed under this head are most extensive; it is not only
mixed with inferior barks, but frequently with genuine bark, the active
constituents of which have been entirely extracted by decoction with water.
In selecting cinchona bark, the following precautions may be useful;
it should be dense, heavy and dry, not musty, nor spoiled by moisture;
a decoction made of it should have a reddish colour when warm;
but when cold, it should become paler, and deposit a brownish red sediment.
When the bark is of a dark <em>colour</em> between red and yellow, it is
either of a bad species, or it has not been well preserved. Its <em>taste</em> should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>be bitter, with a slight acidity, but not nauseous, nor very astringent;
when chewed, it should not appear in threads, nor of much length; the
<em>odour</em> is not very strong, but when bark has been well cured, it is always
perceptible, and the stronger it is, provided it be pleasant, the better may
the bark be considered. In order to give bark the form of <em>quill</em>, the bark
gatherers not unfrequently call in the aid of artificial heat, by which its
virtues are deteriorated; the fraud is detected by the colour being much
darker, and upon splitting the bark, by the inside exhibiting stripes of a
whitish sickly hue. In the form of powder, cinchona is always found
more or less adulterated. During a late official inspection of the shops
of apothecaries and druggists, the Censors repeatedly met with powdered
cinchona having a harsh metallic taste, quite foreign to that which characterizes
good bark.<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c015'><sup>[471]</sup></a> The best test of the goodness of bark is afforded
by the quantity of <em>Cinchonia</em>, or <em>Quina</em> that may be extracted from it;
and the manufacturer should always institute such a trial before he purchases
any quantity, taking a certain number of pieces indiscriminately
from the bulk. Much has been said of late concerning the probability of
the genuine species of the cinchona tree becoming extinct; in consequence
of which some succedaneum has been anxiously sought for; the bark of
the broad-leaved willow, <em>Salix Caprea</em>, has been proposed for this purpose.

purple red powder with a granular crystalline appearance; these chemists
propose to call it <em>Carmine</em>, but as Mr. Children very justly observes, if we
adopt the term, its termination should be altered, to avoid confounding the

    <div>COLCHICI RADIX, <span class='fss'>ET</span> SEMINA. L.E.D.</div>
    <div class='c004'>Colchicum Autumnale.</div>
    <div class='c004'>The <em>Bulb</em> of the Meadow Saffron.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> When recent it has scarcely any <em>odour</em>, but its <em>taste</em> is
bitter, hot and acrid. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> Its properties reside in a
milky juice, and depend upon an alkaline principle; it contains also gum,
starch, inulin, and extractive matter, which, when in solution, undergoes a
chemical change, analogous, I apprehend, to that which takes place in
the infusion of Senna, and it would appear with similar inconvenience.
Sir Everard Home ascertained that this deposit, in the vinous infusion, excites
nausea and griping, but that it may be removed without destroying
the efficacy of the medicine. The alkaline element, similar to that of the
Hellebore (<em>Veratria</em>), lately found in it, appears to exist in combination
with gallic acid. (<em>Annales de Chimie</em>, <em>tom.</em> xiv. <em>Mai</em>, 1820.) This alkaline
body would seem to display its greatest energies by its action upon
mucous surfaces; in small portions it excites violent sneezing, and when
applied to the membrane of the stomach, immediate vomiting and purging
are the result.<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c015'><sup>[474]</sup></a> See <em>Veratri radix</em>. The virtues of the bulb of Colchicum
are very variable, according to the place of growth and season of the
year. Since the third edition of this work, I have been favoured with
some valuable observations upon this subject by Mr. Alexander Gordon;
he says that it is in its greatest perfection from the beginning of June until
the middle of August.<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c015'><sup>[475]</sup></a> It is also necessary to extract the virtues of the
bulb as soon as it is gathered, for although removed from the earth, the
developing process of vegetation continues, and the substance undergoes
a corresponding series of chemical changes, and finally becomes as inert
as if it had remained in the ground. It is a problem of some importance
to discover a method of destroying the vegetable life of the bulb, without
at the same time injuring its virtues, for I apprehend that a want of attention
to the above precaution frequently renders the vinous infusion inactive.
The practitioner engaged in preparing this vegetable remedy
will find some valuable directions in the third edition of Thomson’s Dispensatory.
The flower of the <em>meadow saffron</em> is very poisonous to cattle.
<span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> Vinegar and wine<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c015'><sup>[476]</sup></a> are the best menstrua for extracting its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>active qualities; by decoction its essential oil is dissipated. <span class='sc'>Medicinal
Uses.</span> It has been much extolled on the continent as a remedy in dropsy,
especially in hydro-thorax, and in humoral asthma; its operation however
as a diuretic, is less certain than squill, although its <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> is
analogous to it, as will be seen by referring to our new arrangement of
Diuretic remedies. As a <em>specific</em> in gout its efficacy has been fully
ascertained; it allays pain, and cuts short the paroxysm. It has
also a decided action upon the arterial system, which it would appear
to control through the medium of the nerves. <span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span>
In my opinion, acids, and all oxygenated substances render the
vinous infusion drastic; on the contrary, alkalies render its principles more
soluble, and its operation more mild, but not less efficacious. Magnesia
may judiciously accompany its exhibition. <span class='sc'>Dose</span> of the saturated vinous
infusion, the only form in which its successful operation can be insured,

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Colchici Semina.</span> Dr. Williams of Ipswich has lately published an
account of the efficacy of the <em>Seeds</em> of Colchicum, which he says possess
all the virtues of the root, without its pernicious<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c015'><sup>[477]</sup></a> qualities; the form in
which he administers them, is in that of vinous infusion.<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c015'><sup>[478]</sup></a> He also informs
me that he has experienced considerable tonic effects from these seeds;
and that unlike other narcotic remedies they do not appear to produce, or
favour congestion in the head. The seeds ought not to be bruised, as
their virtues reside chiefly in the husk, or cortical part.</p>

    <div>CONFECTIONES L. <em>Confections.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Under this title the London College comprehends the <em>conserves</em> and <em>electuaries</em>
of its former Pharmacopœias; but in strict propriety, and for practical
convenience, the distinction between <em>conserves</em> and <em>electuaries</em> ought
to have been maintained. Saccharine matter enters into each of these
compositions, but in different proportions, and for different objects. In conserves
it is intended to preserve the virtues of recent vegetables; in electuaries,
to impart convenience of form. See <em>Electuaria</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Confectio Amygdalarum.</span> L. This preparation affords an expeditious
mode of preparing the almond emulsion; it should be used in the
proportion of a drachm to each fluid-ounce of distilled water.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Confectio Aromatica.</span> L. <em>Electuarium Aromaticum</em>. E.D. This is
a very useful combination of various aromatics, to which the London and
Dublin colleges have added a <em>carbonate of lime</em>; this circumstance makes
the preparation a judicious constituent for the exhibition of active salts,
liable to be invalidated by the presence of acid in the stomach, but, at the
same time, rendering it incompatible with <em>acids</em>, <em>antimonial wine</em>, &amp;c.
These observations do not of course extend to the <em>aromatic electuary</em> of the
Edinburgh pharmacopœia. See <em>Form: 15, 42, 49, 125, 126</em>. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, ℈j
to ʒj.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Confectio Cassiæ.</span> L. The ingredients of this confection are manna,
tamarind pulp, and syrup of roses. It is gently laxative, and from its
agreeable flavour is well calculated for children. The pharmaceutist, in
preparing it, must take care that he does not substitute the syrup of the
<em>red</em>, for that of the <em>damask</em> rose; a substitution, as stated under the head
of Syrupi, not very unusual. The confection does not ferment or become
acescent. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, ʒj to ℥j.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Confectio Opii.</span> L. <em>Electuarium Opiatum</em>. E. This is a combination
of aromatics with opium, intended as a substitute for the <em>Mithridate</em> and
<em>Theriaca</em> of the old pharmacopœias. It is highly useful in flatulent cholic
and diarrhœa, and in all cases where a stimulant narcotic is indicated.
One grain of opium is contained in grs. 36 of the London, and in grs. 43
of the Edinburgh preparation. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, grs. x to xxx.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span><span class='sc'>Confectio Piperis Nigri.</span> L. This preparation has been introduced
into the Pharmacopœia, on the suggestion of several eminent practitioners,
who have experienced its utility in certain cases of Piles. It is intended
to resemble <span class='sc'>Ward’s<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c015'><sup>[479]</sup></a> Paste</span>, whose composition has been given in all
the former editions of this work, and according to which Formula the
committee have directed the present preparation. It is principally useful
in those cases attended with considerable debility, in leucophlegmatic
habits, and when piles arise from a deficient secretion in the rectum. On
the other hand, the composition will as certainly prove injurious in those
cases which are accompanied with erysipelatous inflammation, and which
require cooling laxatives, and a total abstinence from all stimulants, for
their cure.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Confectio Rosæ Caninæ</span>, olim <em>Conserva Cynosbati</em>. Its acidity depends
upon uncombined citric acid, a circumstance which it is essential
to remember when we direct its use in combination. The hip, or fruit of
this plant, beat up with sugar, and mixed with wine, is a very acceptable
treat in the north of Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Confectio Rosæ Gallicæ.</span> <em>Confection of the Red Rose.</em> Principally
used as a vehicle for more active medicines. It is sometimes brightened
by the addition of a small proportion of sulphuric acid; this is a circumstance
of great importance, where the confection is used for making
the mercurial pill. See <em>Pilulæ Hydrarg</em>. It is a very common excipient
for pills, see <em>Form: 21, 59, 66, 73, 122, 160, 170</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Confectio Rutæ</span>, <em>Confection of Rue</em>. The principal use of this preparation
is as an ingredient in antispasmodic enemas.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Confectio Scammoneæ.</span> L.D. Scammony, <em>two parts</em>, powdered cloves
and ginger, of each, <em>one part</em>, to which are added a small portion of oil of
carraway, and of syrup of roses, q. s. It is a stimulating cathartic, and
may be given in the dose of ʒss to ʒj.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Confectio Sennæ.</span> L.E.D olim <em>Electuarium Lenitivum</em>. The ingredients
of this preparation are senna leaves, figs, tamarind pulp, cassia
pulp, the pulp of prunes, coriander seeds, liquorice root, and refined sugar.
It is gently laxative, and is an excellent vehicle for the exhibition of more
powerful cathartics. (<em>Form. 74, 93.</em>) When properly made, it is an elegant
preparation, not apt to ferment, nor to become acescent; the directions
of the pharmacopœia are however rarely followed. Jalap blackened
with walnut liquor, is frequently substituted for the more expensive article
cassia; and the great bulk of it, sold in London, is little else than
prunes, figs, and jalap. I understand that a considerable quantity is also
manufactured in Staffordshire, into which unsound and spoilt apples enter
as a principal ingredient. The preparation sold at Apothecaries’ Hall is
certainly unique in excellence. Dose, ʒij or more.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above are the principal confections which are employed in modern
practice, for happily the shops are at length disencumbered of those nauseous
insignificant conserves, unknown to the ancients, but which were
ushered into use by the Arabian physicians, and which continued for so
many years to disgrace our dispensatories and to embarrass our practice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>The French, in their new Codex Medicamentarius, have limited their
electuaries to a number not exceeding nine; they have however made up
in complexity for deficiency in number; the <em>Electuarium de croco</em>, which is
intended to answer the same ends as our confectio aromatica, has no less
than twelve ingredients, although the force of the combination depends
entirely upon carbonate of lime, cinnamon, and saffron; and so it is with
the rest.</p>

    <div>CONII FOLIA. L.E. (Conium Maculatum.)</div>
    <div class='c004'>Cicuta. D. <em>Hemlock.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> The leaves, when properly dried, have a strong and narcotic
odour, and a slightly bitter and nauseous taste: the fresh leaves contain
not only the narcotic, but also the acrid principle: by exsiccation,
the latter is nearly lost, but the former undergoes no change; the medicinal
properties of the leaves are therefore improved by the operation of
drying. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> The medicinal activity of the plant
resides in a resinous element, which may be obtained in an insulated form,
by evaporating an ethereal tincture made with the leaves, on the surface
of water; it has a rich dark green colour, and contains the peculiar odour
and taste of hemlock in perfection; a dose of half a grain will produce
vertigo and head-ache. It may be distinguished by the name of <em>Conein</em>.
The watery extract of this plant can therefore possess but little power,
a fact which Orfila has fully established by experiment. No part of the
plant is entirely destitute of efficacy, though the leaves possess the most
activity. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> Alcohol and æther extract its virtues. <span class='sc'>Incompatible
Substances.</span> Its energies are greatly diminished by vegetable
acids; hence vinegar is its best antidote. <span class='sc'>Medicinal Uses.</span> It is a powerful
sedative, and has been deservedly commended for its powers in allaying
morbid irritability: according to my own experience, it is, in well directed
doses, by far the most efficacious of all palliatives, for quieting pulmonary
irritation. It has been extolled also in the cure of schirrus and
cancer, and it will without doubt prove in such cases a valuable resource,
from its sedative influence. Externally, it will afford considerable relief in
irritable ulcers, when applied in the form of fomentation or cataplasm, see
<em>Form. 17, 18</em>. <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span> The dried leaves, powdered, and

Several different plants have been mistaken for, and employed in

    <div class='c004'><em>Copaiba</em>, <em>Copaiva</em>, or <em>Capivi Balsam</em>.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> <em>Consistence</em>, that of oil, or a little thicker. <em>Colour</em>, pale
golden yellow. <em>Odour</em>, fragrant and peculiar. <em>Taste</em>, aromatic, bitter,
and sharp. <em>Sp. Grav.</em> 0·950. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> It is improperly
denominated a balsam, for it contains no benzoic acid, but consists
of resin and essential oil. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> It is insoluble in water,
but soluble in ten parts of alcohol, and in expressed and essential oils;
with the pure alkalies it forms white saponaceous compounds which
are soluble in water, forming opaque emulsions. <span class='sc'>Medicinal Uses.</span>
Stimulant, diuretic, and laxative; it seems to act more powerfully on
the urinary passages than any of the other resinous fluids; hence its
use in gleets and in fluor albus. Its use gives the urine an intensely
bitter taste, but not a violet smell, as the turpentines do. By referring
to the Synoptical arrangement of Diuretic remedies, it will appear
that <em>Copaiba</em> is referred to Class I, 1. <em>b.</em> for there is reason to believe
that its active principle undergoes absorption, and by coming in
contact with the urinary organs, produces the medicinal effects for which
it is so highly valued. <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span> Diffused in soft or distilled
water by yolk of egg, or by twice its weight of mucilage, fʒss to
every f℥j of water, forms an elegant mixture, or it may be given dropped
on sugar, and in this latter form it is certainly more disposed to act on the
urinary organs, than when exhibited in that of an emulsion. (<em>Form.
156.</em>) Dr. Chapman has proposed a new mode of exhibiting this medicine;
he advises us to pour the Copaiba on half a wine-glassful of water,
and afterwards to add slowly a few drops of a common bitter tincture, by
which means the Copaiba will be collected in a small globule that may
be easily swallowed, while its taste, so nauseous to most patients, will be
entirely masked by the bitterness of the vehicle. In whatever form,
however, this medicine is administered, it is extremely apt to derange the
digestive organs, if long continued, and the unpleasant effects thus occasioned
remain, in some cases, for a very long period.<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c015'><sup>[480]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span>
A considerable quantity sold in London is entirely <em>factitious</em>. A curious
trial took place some time since, between the owner of certain premises
that were burnt down, and the Governors of the Sun Fire Office, in consequence
of the latter refusing to indemnify the proprietor for his loss, because
the fire had been occasioned by his <em>making</em> Balsam of Copaiba.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>This article is also adulterated with mastiche and oil; M. Bucholz asserts
that if it does not dissolve in a mixture of four parts of pure alcohol,
and one of rectified æther, we may infer its adulteration; <em>rape oil</em> is
also frequently mixed with it, in which case if dropped into water, the
drops will not retain their spherical form, as they invariably will, if pure.</p>

<p class='c007'>The horns of the stag differ only from bone, in containing less of the

One hundred parts consist of sixty-two of extractive, the remaining

matter very accurately, and from the circumstance of its watery infusion
assuming different colours when treated with different agents, they
have named it <em>polychroite</em>. Thus chlorine and light destroy its colour,
sulphuric acid changes it to indigo, which gradually becomes lilac, and
nitric acid gives it a green hue. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> It yields its colour and

arises when the saffron is thrown upon live coals; the latter, by infusing
the specimen in hot water, when the expanded stigmata may be easily

colour and odour in the infusion indicates that a tincture or infusion has
already been drawn from the saffron, and that it has been subsequently
pressed again into a cake. In the market is to be found saffron from Sicily,
France, and Spain, besides the English; that which is imported from
Spain, is generally spoiled with oil, in which it is dipt with the intention
of preserving it. The cake saffron sold in some of the less respectable
shops, consists of one part of saffron and nine of marigold, made into a
cake with oil, and then pressed; it is sold in considerable quantities for
the use of birds, when in moult.</p>

    <div class='c004'><em>Cubebs</em>, or <em>Java Pepper</em>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This Indian spice, a native of Java, formerly held a place in our materia
medica, and entered into the composition of <em>mithridate</em> and <em>theriaca</em>,
but being inferior in pungency and aromatic warmth to pepper, it fell into
disuse. Lately, however, it has been ushered into surgical practice for
the cure of gonorrhœa, with all the extravagance of praise which usually
attends the revival of an old, or the introduction of a new medicine.<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c015'><sup>[482]</sup></a> It
has been pronounced to be a specific in this complaint, if taken in the
early stages, in the dose of a dessert-spoonful three times a day, in a sufficient
quantity of water.<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c015'><sup>[483]</sup></a> The Indians have been long acquainted with
the influence which cubebs exerts upon these organs; thus Garcias, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apud
Indos cubebarum in vino maceratarum est usus ad exitandam venerem</span></i>.” <span class='sc'>Chemical
Composition.</span> M. Vauquelin has lately made a very accurate
analysis of this pepper, from which its composition may be stated as follows:
1. A volatile oil, which is nearly solid.—2. A resin, <em>resembling Balsam
of Copaiba</em>.—3. Another and coloured resin.—4. A coloured gummy
matter.—5. An extractive principle, similar to that which is found in leguminous
plants.—6. Some saline substances. He considers the resin
<em>resembling the Copaiba</em>, to be the peculiar matter in which that property
resides, which imparts to it the power of curing gonorrhœa. As the
qualities of this spice do not reside in volatile elements, an extract made
with rectified spirit will be found to possess the whole of its virtues. The
French, in their new <cite>Codex Medicamentarius</cite>, have introduced the cubebs
into their list of materia medica. There is a precaution, with respect to
the exhibition of Cubebs, which it is important for the practitioner to remember—to
keep the bowels thoroughly open; for where hardened fæces
are allowed to accumulate, the spice insinuates itself into the mass, and
produces excoriations in the rectum. <span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> The “Turkey
Yellow Berries,” i. e. the dried fruit of the <em>Rhamnus Catharticus</em>, are often
substituted for the Cubebs, and the similarity between them is so great,
that the casual observer may be easily deceived.</p>

bark, which has been called <span class='sc'>Fine Angustura</span>, but which is of a different
species, and is a very energetic poison. This bark is characterized by
having its epidermis covered with a matter which has the appearance of
rust of iron, and which, moreover, possesses certain chemical properties
of this metal; for if water acidulated with muriatic acid be agitated in
contact with its powder, it assumes a beautiful green colour, and affords
with an alkaline prussiate, (<em>Hydro-cyanate of Potass</em>) a Prussian blue precipitate.
Late researches have detected the presence of an alkaline element
in this bark, on which the name of <em>Brucia</em> has been bestowed. When
this alkali is dissolved in boiling alcohol, and crystallized by spontaneous
evaporation, it yields colourless and transparent crystals in the form of
oblique quadrangular prisms.</p>

in water, and in cold alcohol, but boiling alcohol dissolves it. It has
been obtained with difficulty in the form of quadrangular prisms. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span>
The medicinal powers of the herb are alike extracted by aqueous
and spirituous menstrua. <span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span> The infusion is
precipitated by the salts of lead, silver, mercury, and iron; the mineral
acids would also appear to produce some essential changes which may diminish
its efficacy. Acetic acid increases its powers, although it relieves
the effects of an overdose, if administered after the stomach has been
emptied. This apparent anomaly is easily explained when we consider,
that in the first case its operation is purely <em>chemical</em>, increasing the solubility
of the active principle of the plant, while in the latter case it operates
as a <em>vital</em> agent, restoring to the nervous system that energy which
has been suspended by the narcotic influence of the vegetable. <span class='sc'>Medicinal
Uses.</span> It is narcotic, and has been regarded by many authors as
eminently antispasmodic; Dr. Barton, an American physician, made very
extensive trials of its efficacy in Mania, the result of which is highly favourable
to its use. Dr. Marcet first noticed its salutary effects in chronic
diseases attended with violent pain; he found it to lessen powerfully, and
quickly, sensibility and pain, and to produce a sort of nervous shock, attended
with a momentary affection of the head and eyes, with a degree
of nausea, and with phenomena resembling those which are produced by
intoxication. It seems to be more particularly beneficial in chronic rheumatism,
sciatica, &amp;c. Its root, smoked in the manner of tobacco, has been
much extolled as a remedy in the paroxysms of spasmodic asthma; this
practice however, is not unattended with danger;<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c015'><sup>[488]</sup></a> the same transient
feelings of relief may be procured by smoking a mixture of opium and
any aromatic herb. <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span> Some discrepancy of opinion
has existed upon this point; the native practitioners in the Carnatic
gave the powdered root; Hufeland recommends a tincture of the whole
plant; in this country an extract of the leaves, or, more lately, of the
seeds, has been preferred, and I have been recently informed by Sir Henry
Halford, that he has found a tincture made with the seeds,<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c015'><sup>[489]</sup></a> a very efficient
and unobjectionable preparation. Dr. Davy, at my request, has made a
series of experiments upon the extracts prepared by Mr. Barry <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</span></i>,

    <div>DECOCTA. L.E.D. <em>Decoctions.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These are solutions of the active principles of vegetables obtained by
boiling them in water. To decide upon the expediency of this form of preparation,
in each particular case, requires a knowledge of the chemical composition
of the substance in question. In conducting the operation, the
following rules must be observed.</p>

<p class='c065'>1. <em>Those substances only should be decocted, whose medicinal powers
reside in principles which are soluble in water.</em></p>

<p class='c065'>2. <em>If the active principle be volatile, decoction must be an injurious
process; and, if it consist of extractive matter, long boiling, by favouring
its oxidizement, will render it insipid, insoluble, and inert.</em></p>

<p class='c065'>3. <em>The substances to be decocted should be previously bruised, or sliced,
so as to expose an extended surface to the action of the water.</em></p>

<p class='c065'>4. <em>The substances should be completely covered with water, and the
vessel slightly closed, in order to prevent, as much as possible, the access
of air: the boiling should be continued without interruption, and gently.</em></p>

<p class='c065'>5. <em>In compound decoctions, it is sometimes convenient not to put in all
the ingredients from the beginning, but in succession, according to their
hardness, and the difficulty with which their virtues are extracted; and if
any aromatic, or other substances containing volatile principles, or oxidizable
matter, enter into the composition, the boiling decoction should be
simply poured upon them, and covered up until cold.</em></p>

<p class='c065'>6. <em>The relative proportions of different vegetable substances to the
water, must be regulated by their nature; the following general rule may
be admitted; of roots, barks, or dried woods, from ʒij to ʒvj to every
pint of water; of herbs, leaves, or flowers, half that quantity will suffice.</em></p>

<p class='c065'>7. <em>The decoction ought to be filtered through linen, while hot, as important
portions of the dissolved matter are frequently deposited on cooling;
care must be also taken that the filtre is not too fine, for it frequently happens,
that the virtues of a decoction depend upon the presence of particles
which are suspended in a minutely divided state.</em></p>

<p class='c065'>8. <em>A decoction should be prepared in small quantities only, and never
employed, especially in summer, forty-eight hours after it has been made.
It should be considered as an extemporaneous preparation, but introduced
into the pharmacopœia for the purpose of convenience, and for the sake of
abridging the labour of the physician.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>It is very important that the water employed for making decoctions,
should be free from that quality which is denominated <em>hardness</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The officinal decoctions may be classed into simple and compound preparations.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>1. <em>Simple.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Decoctum Cinchonæ.</span> See Cinchona, and <em>Form: 41, 42, 127</em>. The
codex of Paris directs a decoction of bark, “<em>Decoctum Kinœ Kinœ</em>,” which
is only half the strength of ours, but contains an addition of a small quantity
of carbonate of potass.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Decoctum Cydoniæ.</span> The inner coats of the seeds of the Quince
(<em>Pyrus Cydonia</em>) yield a very large proportion of mucilage, but as hot water
extracts from them also fecula and other principles, the decoction very
soon decomposes. It has been strongly recommended as an application
to erysipelatous surfaces; and it would seem to be peculiarly adapted for
such a purpose, since it is not so easily washed away from the part to
which it is applied, as ordinary mucilage; for the same reason it has been
preferred as an ingredient in injections, gargles, &amp;c. It is stated by some
practitioners to be a very useful application, when united with the <em>acetate
of lead</em>, in cases of acute ophthalmia; such a combination, however, is extremely
unchemical, and must invalidate the powers of the other ingredients.
The native practitioners of India employ it as a cooling mucilaginous
drink in gonorrhœa. An ounce of bruised Quince seed will make
three pints of water as thick and ropy as the white of an egg; hence two
drachms, the quantity directed by the College, is amply sufficient for a
pint of the decoction. It is coagulated by <em>alcohol</em>, <em>acids</em>, and <em>metallic salts</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Decoctum Digitalis.</span> D. This is a very improper form for the exhibition
of digitalis, being variable in strength.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Decoctum Dulcamaræ.</span> L. In making this decoction we must take
care that the operation of boiling is not continued too long. See <em>Dulcamaræ
Caules</em>. <span class='sc'>Dose</span> from f℥ss to f℥j.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Decoctum Lichenis.</span> L.E.D. In this preparation we have the bitter
principle of the plant united with its fecula. A portion of the former may
be removed by macerating the lichen, and rejecting the first water. If
℥j of the mass be boiled for a quarter of an hour in f℥vj of water, we shall
obtain mucilage of a consistence similar to that composed of one part of
gum arabic and three of water. Its exhibition requires the same precaution
as that of <em>Mucilago Acaciæ</em>. From the large proportion of fecula
which this moss contains, it is perhaps as nutritive as any vegetable substance,
the <em>Cerealia</em> of course excepted. See <em>Lichen Island</em>. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, a
wine glass full occasionally.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Decoctum Papaveris.</span> L. In making this decoction the whole of the
capsule should be bruised, in order to obtain its mucilage and anodyne
principle; the seeds should be also retained, as they yield a portion of
bland oil which increases the emollient quality of the decoction. A large
quantity of fixed oil is constantly in the market, which is derived from the
seeds of the poppy. This decoction is a useful fomentation in painful
swellings, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Decoctum Quercus.</span> L.E. Decoction is the usual form in which
<em>Oak Bark</em> is exhibited, since all its active principles are soluble in water.
Its astringent virtues depend upon gallic acid, tannin, and extractive.
The decoction is disturbed by the following substances; the <em>infusion of
yellow cinchona</em>; <em>sub-acetate</em> and <em>acetate of lead</em>; <em>solutions of isinglass</em>; the
<em>preparations of iron</em>; <em>oxy-muriate of mercury</em>; and <em>sulphate of zinc</em>; all <em>alkaline
substances</em> destroy its astringency, and are consequently incompatible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>with it. It is principally useful as a local astringent, in the forms of
gargle, injection, or lotion. Its internal exhibition in obstinate diarrhœas,
and alvine hemorrhages, has also proved highly beneficial. See <em>Form:
51, 61</em>. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, f℥ss to f℥j. Dr. Eberle states that in the Intermittents
of very young children, he has in some cases used this decoction as a bath
with efficacy.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Decoctum Sarsaparillæ.</span> L.E.D. See Sarsaparilla. In making
this decoction, it is rarely properly digested or boiled for a sufficient length
of time to extract its virtues. The only salts which occasion precipitates
in this decoction are, <em>nitrate of mercury</em> and <em>acetate of lead</em>; <em>lime water</em> has
the same effect. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, f℥iv to f℥vj.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Decoctum Veratri.</span> Stimulant and acrid; internally, it is cathartic,
but too violent to be safely exhibited; it is useful as a lotion in scabies, and
other cutaneous eruptions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Decoctum Aloes Compositum.</span> It resembles the well known <em>Beaume
de vie</em>, although less purgative, and is a scientific preparation, constructed
upon the true principles of medicinal combination. Aloes is the base, to
which are added, 1st, sub-carbonate of potass, 2ndly, powdered myrrh,
3dly, extract of liquorice, 4thly, saffron, and after the decoction is made,
5thly, compound tincture of cardamoms. By the 1st ingredient the aloes
is rendered more soluble; the 2d and 3d suspend the portion not dissolved,
and at the same time disguise its bitterness; the 4th imparts an aromatic
flavour, and the 5th not only renders it more grateful to the stomach, but
prevents any spontaneous decomposition from taking place. Its taste is
improved by keeping. It is a warm, gentle cathartic. <em>Form: 80.</em> <span class='sc'>Dose</span>,
f℥ss to f℥j. Its operation is different from that of simple aloes. See

potass.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Decoctum Guaiaci Compositum.</span> E. Commonly called <em>Decoction of
woods.</em> This decoction has fallen into disuse, and deservedly, for it can
possess but little power, except, as a diluent, or demulcent; the water takes

It is directly sedative, although some maintain the contrary opinion, diminishing
the frequency of the pulse, and the general irritability of the
system, and increasing the action of the absorbents, and the discharge by
urine. The effects appear to be in a great degree connected with its sensible
influence upon the body, which is indicated by feelings of slight
nausea and languor; accordingly, every attempt to prevent these unpleasant
effects, or to <em>correct</em> the operation of digitalis, by combining it
with aromatic, or stimulant medicines, seems to be fatal to the diuretic
powers of the remedy. Dr. Blackall, in his “Observations upon the cure
of Dropsies,” has offered some remarks which bear upon this point, and
to which I have before referred. <em>See page 96 &amp; 150.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Several of the formulæ introduced under the class of diuretics are combinations
supported by high authority, but it is doubtful whether their
adoption can be sanctioned upon principle; they are however well calculated
to illustrate the nature of diuretic compounds, and this is the only
purpose for which they were selected. See <em>Form: 103</em>. The French
have introduced in their new Codex, an ethereal tincture, <em>Tinctura Ætherea</em>
<em>Digitalis purpureæ</em>, in which the sedative influence of the plant must be
entirely overwhelmed by the stimulant properties of the menstruum.
Under the head of <em>Diuretics</em>, I have so fully considered the value of
diuretic combinations, and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> of Digitalis, that it is
unnecessary to dwell upon the subject in this place. Digitalis has
considerable influence over the action of the heart; and in certain diseases,
attended with inordinate motions of that organ, it proves eminently
serviceable; I have employed it with great satisfaction in cases of palpitation
connected with a state of general irritability, so frequently occurring
in female disorders; and according to my observations where it succeeds,
opium generally does harm. <em>Form: 32.</em> <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span>
In substance, tincture, or infusion; the latter form is most efficient as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>diuretic. <span class='sc'>Dose</span> of the powdered leaves gr. j, in a pill, twice a day; the
augmentation of the dose should proceed at the rate of one-fourth of the
original quantity, every second day, until its operation becomes apparent,
either on the kidneys, or on the constitution generally. If it produce such
a disturbance in the primæ viæ as to occasion vomiting or purging, its
diuretic powers will be lost; in such a case the addition of a small portion
of opium, or opiate confection, may be expedient. The distressing effects
of an overdose are best counteracted by tincture of opium in brandy and
water, and by the application of a blister to the pit of the stomach. A
London Surgeon has lately stated that he has prescribed the tincture of
Digitalis, in the dose of twenty-five drops, three times a day, in barley-water,
with great success in Gonorrhæa. <span class='sc'>Officinal Preparations.</span>

It is very important that the leaves of this plant be properly collected, and
accurately preserved; they should be gathered when the plant is beginning
to flower, and, as it is biennial, in the second year of its growth; the
largest and deepest coloured flowers should be also selected, for they are
the most powerful; they should be also carefully dried until they become
crisp, or they will lose much of their virtue; the too common method of
tying them in bundles, and hanging them up to dry, should be avoided,
for a fermentation is produced by such means, and the parts least exposed
soon become rotten. The powdered leaves ought to be preserved in opaque
bottles, and kept from the action of light as well as of air and moisture;
a damp atmosphere has, upon a principle already explained, a very injurious
operation, by carrying off those faint poisonous effluvia with which
its efficacy seems to be ultimately connected.</p>

over the <em>Emplastrum Hydrargyri</em>. It is also powerfully adhesive.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span><span class='sc'>Emplastrum Cantharidis.</span> L. <em>Emplast: Cantharidis vesicatoriæ.</em>
E.D. A variety of substances has in different times been employed for
producing vesication, but no one has been found to answer with so much
certainty and mildness as the <em>Lyttæ</em>. All the others are apt to leave ill
conditioned ulcers: true it is, that the emplastrum lyttæ will occasionally
fail, but this is generally attributable to some inattention, or want of caution
on the part of the person who prepares it; in spreading it, the spatula
should never be heated beyond the degree of boiling water; the
plaster also should be sufficiently secured on the part by slips of adhesive
plaster, but it ought not to be bound on too tight; where the cuticle is
thick, the application of a poultice for an hour, previous to that of the
blister, will be useful, or the part may be washed with vinegar. In consequence
of the absorption of the active principle of the <em>Lyttæ</em>, blisters
are apt to occasion strangury and bloody urine; it has been a problem
therefore of some importance to discover a plan by which such an absorption
may be obviated, for this purpose, camphor has been recommended
to be mixed with the blistering composition, and a piece of thin
gauze has been interposed between the plaster and the skin; but it has
been lately found, that ebullition in water deprives the <em>Cantharides</em> of all
power of thus acting on the kidneys, without in the least diminishing
their vesicatory properties: the ordinary time required for the full action
of a blister is ten or twelve hours, but if it be applied to the head, double
that period will be necessary. Children, owing to delicacy of skin, are
more speedily blistered, the epispastic may therefore be removed earlier. In
some cases the blistered parts, instead of healing kindly, become a spreading
sore; whenever this occurs, poultices are the best applications; it
may arise from a peculiar irritability of the constitution, although I apprehend
that it not unfrequently depends upon the sophistication of the
plaster with euphorbium. In cases where it is desirable to keep up the
local irritation, it is still a question with some practitioners whether it be
more advisable to encourage a discharge from the vesicated part by some
appropriate stimulant, or to renew the vesication at short intervals by repeated
blisters; the latter mode is perhaps to be preferred, as being more
effectual, and certainly less troublesome to the patient: it has moreover
been stated,<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c015'><sup>[495]</sup></a> that by a repeated application of this nature, the influence
excited appears to extend much deeper, so as to derive a greater quantity
of blood from the immediate neighbourhood of the vessels, or from
the vessels themselves which are in a state of disease, than the influence
excited by an application less stimulating upon the surface of a part already
abraded. The character of the discharge would likewise appear
essentially different; it being in the latter cast a purulent secretion from
the superficial exhalants of the surface only; in the former, a copious
effusion of serum, mixed with a large portion of lymph, produced from a
deeper order of vessels.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The boneset is a plant indigenous to the United States, and is to be
found in the neighbourhood of marshes and low situations. It is intensely
bitter and somewhat astringent. According to the analysis of Dr. Andrew
Anderson of New-York, it yields, 1. A free acid; 2. Tannin; 3.
Extractive matter; 4. A gummy matter; 5. A resin; 6. Azote; 7.
Lime, probably the acetate of lime; 8. Gallic acid, probably modified;
9. A resiniform matter, soluble in water and in alcohol, and which seems
to contain a bitter principle. It also appears from this analysis that the
free acid may be obtained from all parts of the plant—that tannin is obtained
in much the largest quantity from the leaves, and least from the
roots—that the extractive and gummy matter reside chiefly in the roots—that
the leaves and flowers also contain a larger proportion of resin than
the roots—and that azote exists in the flowers, leaves, and roots. The
principal properties of the boneset are those of a tonic and diaphoretic.
The diseases in which it has been prescribed with success are intermitting
and remitting fevers, typhoid peripneumony and catarrh. It may be
given in powder, infusion, or tincture. When given as a tonic, the tincture
is the preferable form. The dose of the powder is from 20 to 30

    <div>EXTRACTA. L.E.D. <em>Extracts.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These preparations are obtained by evaporating the watery or spirituous
solutions of vegetables, and the native juices obtained from fresh
plants by expression, to masses of a tenacious consistence. The London
college does not arrange the extracts under the titles of <em>watery</em> and <em>resinous</em>,
which is the arrangement of the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia, nor
under those of simple and resinous, which is the division observed in that
of Dublin, but rejecting all <em>specific</em> distinctions, includes, under the <em>generic</em>
appellation of extract, both the species, as well as all the <em>inspissated juices</em>.
Since however the former of these arrangements will afford greater facilities
for introducing the observations which it is my intention to offer, it
is retained in this work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chemical nature of extracts must obviously be very complicated
and variable, depending in a great degree upon the powers of the <em>menstruum</em>
employed for their preparation; although Fourcroy and Vauquelin
considered that <em>one peculiar</em> principle was the basis of them all, which they
called <em>Extract</em>, <em>Extractive</em>, or the <em>Extractive Principle</em>. It is distinguished
by the following characters, <em>viz</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has a strong taste, varying in different plants; it is soluble in water,
and in alcohol when it contains water, but is quite insoluble in <em>absolute</em> alcohol
and æther; its aqueous solution soon runs into a state of putrefaction;
by repeated solutions and evaporations, or by long ebullition, it acquires
a deeper colour, and in consequence of its combination with oxygen
it becomes insoluble and inert, a fact which is of extreme importance as it
regards its pharmaceutical relations; it unites with alumine, and if boiled
with its salts, precipitates it, hence wool, cotton, or thread, impregnated
with alum, may be dyed of a fawn-colour by <em>extractive</em>; its habitudes with
alkalies are very striking, combining most readily and forming with them
compounds of a brownish yellow colour, which are very soluble in water;
if to a colourless and extremely dilute solution of extractive, an alkali be
added, a brown or yellowish tint is immediately produced, so that under
certain circumstances I have found an alkali to be a serviceable test in detecting
the presence of extractive matter. The usual brown hue of
the <em>liquor ammoniæ acetatis</em>, is owing to the action of the ammonia upon
traces of vegetable extractive contained in the distilled vinegar.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much confusion has arisen from the word <em>extract</em> having been employed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>in this double meaning,—<em>chemically</em> to express a peculiar vegetable proximate
principle, and <em>pharmaceutically</em> to denote any substance however complicated
in its nature, which has been obtained by the evaporation of a
vegetable solution or a native vegetable juice. It is in the latter sense that
it is to be understood in the present article.</p>

<p class='c007'>The different proximate principles of vegetable matter undergo various
and indefinite changes with such rapidity, when acted upon by heat, that
the process of <em>extraction</em> must necessarily more or less impair the medicinal
efficacy of a plant, and not unfrequently destroy it altogether, and hence,
says Dr. Murray, “with the exception of some of the pure bitters, as
gentian, or some of the saccharine vegetables, as liquorice, there is no medicine
perhaps but what may be given with more advantage under some
other form;” this however is not exactly true, for when care is taken in the
preparation, we are thus enabled to concentrate <em>many</em> very powerful qualities
in a small space, and the process lately adopted of evaporating the
solutions by the aid of steam, contributes very materially to obviate the
failures which so frequently occurred from a too exalted temperature.
There is, for instance, great reason to suppose that the black colour which
so often characterises the extracts of commerce, is frequently owing to the
decomposition and carbonization of the vegetable matter; the colour
therefore of an extract becomes in some degree a test of its goodness. I
have lately examined the extracts of commerce with some attention, and
I find the presence of iron by no means an uncommon circumstance;
when thus contaminated they afford a very dirty coloured solution, which
rapidly becomes darker on exposure to air. The extracts mentioned in
the preface as made by Mr. Barry, by <em>evaporating in vacuo</em>, deserve the attention
of the profession; the principle is without doubt well calculated
to secure the active matter of the plant from those changes to which it
is constantly liable during the ordinary operation of inspissation. The
extracts, thus prepared, are certainly more powerful in their effects, and
some few of them appear also to possess properties which are not to be
distinguished in the Extracts of Commerce; those of narcotic plants, as
<em>Hemlock</em>, <em>Hyoscyamus</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em> are decidedly more efficacious; where the
practitioner directs their use, he should, to prevent any mistake, add the
words <em>in vacuo præp.</em> as in <em>Formula 4</em>; for on account of the difference in
the strength of these preparations, and of those prepared by the ordinary
method, they cannot be indiscriminately employed. Dr. John Davy, at
my request, has made trial of these extracts in the Military Hospital at
Fort Pitt, and as his results coincide with those obtained in my own practice,
I shall relate, under the history of each Extract, the comparative
conclusions which have been obtained.</p>

<p class='c007'>These extracts must, of course, contain all the principles of a plant
which are soluble in water, such as gum, extractive matter, tannin, cinchonin,
sugar, fecula, &amp;c. together with any soluble salts which the vegetable
may contain. I have also found by experiment that an aqueous
extract may even contain, in small proportions, certain elements which, although
quite insoluble in water, are nevertheless partially soluble in vegetable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>infusion. This law of vegetable chemistry has never been expressed,
although we have repeated instances of its truth, and a knowledge of it
may explain some hitherto unintelligible anomalies. It has been stated
that extractive matter is perfectly insoluble in æther, but Mr. A. Thomson
found repeatedly, that if a small portion of resin was present, æther would
in that case take up extractive in combination with the resin which it so
readily dissolves. As decoction or infusion is a process preliminary to that
of extraction, the practitioner must refer to those articles for an enumeration
of the different sources of error which are attached to them.</p>

by the process of extraction; in this case the volatile oil is dissipated, and
a simple bitter remains, possessing scarcely any of the characteristic properties
of chamomile. This remark, however, does not apply to this extract,
when prepared <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</span></i>. I have lately received from Mr. Pope of
Oxford Street, a specimen which retains, in the most eminent degree, all
the odour and taste of the recent flower. <em>Dose</em>, gr. x–℈j.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Cinchonæ.</span> L.D. The properties of the bark in this
preparation are much invalidated, owing to the oxidizement of its extractive
matter, which takes place to such an extent, that not more than one
half of the preparation is soluble in water; it is not however altogether
devoid of utility, and will often sit lightly on the stomach, when the powder
is rejected. Its taste is very bitter, but less austere than the powder.
The most beautiful extract of bark, which I have ever seen, was prepared
by Mr. Barry of Plough Court; its colour was that of a deep brilliant
ruby, and its flavour preserved all the characteristic peculiarity of the recent
substance.<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c015'><sup>[499]</sup></a> <em>Dose</em>, grs. x to ʒss. Fourteen ounces of the bark will
yield about three ounces and a half of extract. It should be kept <em>soft</em>, so
as to be fit for forming pills, and <em>hard</em>, so that it may be reduced to powder.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Colocynthidis.</span> L. This extract is much milder, although
less powerful, than the pulp; <em>Dose</em>, grs. v to ʒss. It soon becomes
hard and mouldy.<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c015'><sup>[500]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Gentianæ.</span> L.E.D. The bitter principle suffers no deterioration
in the process: it is used principally as a vehicle for metallic
preparations. <em>Form. 36, 53, 103.</em> <em>Dose</em>, gr. x to ℈j.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Glycyrrhizæ.</span> L.D. It is usually imported from Spain;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>in the coarser kinds, the pulps of various plums and of prunes are added;
it should dissolve in water without leaving any feculence.<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c015'><sup>[501]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Hæmatoxyli.</span> L.E.D. The astringent properties of the
<em>logwood</em> are preserved in the extract, but it becomes so extremely hard,
that pills made of it very commonly pass through the body without undergoing
the least change. <em>Dose</em>, grs. x to ʒss dissolved in cinnamon
water: it sometimes imparts a bloody hue to the urine of those who have
taken it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Humuli.</span> L. The bitter taste of the hop characterises
this preparation; whether it possesses, or not, any anodyne properties,
seems very doubtful. <em>Dose</em>, grs. v to ℈j.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Opii.</span> L.D. As it contains less resinous matter than
crude opium, it is supposed to produce its effects with less subsequent derangement.
See <em>Opium</em>. <em>Dose</em>, gr. j to v, for an adult.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Papaveris.</span> L.D. It is a weak opium. <em>Dose</em>, grs. ij
to ℈j.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Sarsaparillæ.</span> Notwithstanding the reputation which
this preparation has acquired, it is very doubtful whether it possesses
any medicinal powers. <em>Dose</em>, gr. x to ʒj in pills, or dissolved in the decoction.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Stramonii.</span> This extract was first recommended by
Stöerck, as a powerful remedy in maniacal affections; its probable value
in such diseases appears to have been suggested by a very curious process
of reasoning, viz. that as it deranged the intellect of the sane, it
might possibly correct that of the insane. Experience has certainly not
confirmed the very sanguine report of Stöerck with regard to its powers,
but it has satisfactorily shewn its occasional value in violent paroxysms, in
quieting the mind, and procuring rest. I am informed by my friend Dr.
Davy, that, for such an object, it has been very frequently and successfully
given, in the Lunatic Military Hospital at Fort Clarence. He farther
states that he has himself made many trials with the extract of Stramonium,
prepared by Mr. Barry (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</span></i>) as well as with the common extract;
and that he finds the former to be uniformly more powerful. “In
most diseases,” says he, “this medicine would seem uncertain in its operation,
sometimes occasioning an anodyne effect, and, at other times, producing
irritation, and preventing sleep; I have, however, seen very beneficial
effects from it in asthma, and in coughs that have a nightly exacerbation,
in doses of from gr. 1/4 to gr. 2, daily.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Taraxaci.</span> L.D. The medicinal powers of Dandelion
are asserted to exist unimpaired in this preparation, but it becomes inert
by keeping. See <em>Taraxacum</em>. <em>Dose.</em> grs. x to ʒj, in combination with sulphate
of potass.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These may contain, with the exception of gum, all the ingredients contained
in watery extracts, besides resin; their composition however will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>greatly depend upon the strength of the spirit employed as the solvent;
but of this I shall speak more fully under the article <em>Tincture</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Cinchonæ Resinosum.</span> L.E.D. The operation of spirit
in this preparation is two-fold; it extracts from the bark the element which
is insoluble in water, and it diminishes the tendency in the extractive matter
to absorb oxygen during the process. <em>Dose</em>, grs. x to xxx. It is said
that a spurious extract of bark is to be met with in the market, consisting
of the extract of the horse-chesnut tree bark, and yellow resin.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Extractum Colocynthidis compositum.</span></span> L.D. <em>Extract. Catharticum.</em>
P.L. 1775. <em>Pilulæ Rudii.</em> P.L. 1720. This preparation has been established
through successive pharmacopœias, and has undergone some
modification in each; in the present edition the soap has been restored,
and its solubility is thereby increased, as well as its mildness as a cathartic.
The omission of this ingredient was formerly suggested by the consideration
of its being incompatible with <em>Calomel</em>; this however is <em>not</em> the case.
It presents a combination of purgative substances which is highly judicious,
and will be found to be more powerful than an equivalent dose of
any <em>one</em> of the ingredients. <em>Dose</em>, gr. v to ʒss, <em>Form. 71, 81, 88.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Jalapæ.</span> L.E.D. It is purgative, but is liable to gripe, unless
it be triturated with sugar and almonds, or mucilage, so as to form an

    <div>3. <em>Inspissated Juices.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These preparations are obtained by expressing the juices from fresh
plants, and evaporating them in a water-bath; they are generally of a
lighter colour than common extracts, and they are certainly much more
active, although there is a great difference in the activity of different
samples; and perhaps the <em>medicinal</em> powers of the juices themselves are
very much under the controul of soil and season. That they <em>vary in
quantity</em> from such causes we have ample proof; thus in moist seasons,
Beaumé obtained five pounds of inspissated juice from thirty pounds of
<em>elder berries</em>, whereas, in dry seasons, he could rarely get more than two.
From <em>hemlock</em> he procured in October, 1796, 7·5 per cent. of inspissated
juice, and in May of the same year only 3·7; on the contrary, in August,
1768, 4 per cent., and in May, 1776, as much as 6·5; but in general, the
product in the autumnal months was the most considerable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The modes of preparing the inspissated juices of the same plant vary
in the different pharmacopœias, and in several points that are very <em>essential</em>;
some direct the expressed juices to be <em>immediately</em> inspissated, others
allow them to undergo a slight degree of fermentation, and some <em>defecate</em>
them, before they proceed to their inspissation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum</span> (<em>Succus Spissatus.</em> E.) <span class='sc'>Aconiti.</span> L.E. The medicinal
properties of this preparation are analogous to those of the recent <em>Wolfsbane</em>,
viz. narcotic, and in some cases diuretic, (see <em>Form. 128</em>.) It is however
rarely used. <em>Dose</em>, at first, should not exceed gr. ½, but it may be
gradually increased. I have not yet, says Dr. Davy, in a letter recently
received from him, had much experience of the <em>Extractum Aconiti</em>, but that
little is favourable to its use; “in some cases of chronic rheumatism, and
in some of intermittent fever, complicated with visceral disease, it has had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>a beneficial effect not to be mistaken; the dose has been from one to two
grains.” Dr. Stöerck, who first tried this medicine, observed from it a
powerful diaphoretic effect; this, says Dr. Davy, “I have not noticed,
and yet the extract which I have used was prepared by Mr. Barry, <em>in
vacuo</em>, which is certainly far more powerful than that employed by Stöerck;
the latter, when applied to the tongue, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">levissimam tantum titillationem excitabat</span></i>,”
whereas that of Mr. Barry produces a most disagreeable sensation
of burning, which extends to the throat; and in one instance, when
applied to the tip of my tongue, it occasioned ulceration.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Belladonnæ.</span> L.E. See <em>Belladonnæ Folia</em>. <em>Dose</em>, gr.
j, gradually increased to gr. v, in the form of pill. Dr. Davy has made a
few trials of Barry’s Extract; the results of which he informs me are not
at all favourable to the use of this medicine; it is much more powerful
than the common extract, and can only be given with safety in small
doses; “in several instances,” says he, “I have not been able to repeat a
grain dose daily, more than thrice, on account of the alarming symptoms
produced, as head-ache, vertigo, indistinct vision with dilated pupil, and,
in one case, irritation of the bladder, occasioning very frequent micturition;
in chronic rheumatism and catarrh, with severe cough, the only diseases
in which I have yet given it, it has not appeared to be in the least serviceable;
it may probably prove valuable to the oculist; from trials that
have been made of it here by Mr. Miller, Assistant Surgeon to the Forces,
it has been found to dilate the pupil beyond the common extract. Stöerck
even introduced his extract into the eye with impunity. Acrid as the
preparation is which I have used, the patients have never complained of
it, nor have I known any disagreeable effects from it, when applied in
solution, sufficiently dilute.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum</span> (<em>Succus Spissatus.</em> E.D.) <span class='sc'>Conii.</span> L. Much of this extract,
as it is found in commerce, has not been prepared with equal fidelity,
nor with due attention to the season when the plant is in its greatest perfection;
Dr. Fothergill says, “I know from repeated experiments, that
the extract which has been prepared from <em>hemlock</em>, before the plant arrives
at maturity, is much inferior to that which is made when the plant has
acquired its full vigour, and is rather on the verge of decline: just when
the flowers fade, the rudiments of the seeds become observable, and the
habit of the plant inclines to yellow, <em>is the proper time</em> to collect it;” the
plants which grow in places exposed to the sun should be selected, as
being more <em>virose</em> than those that grow in the shade: still however with
every precaution, it will always be uncertain in strength. Orfila found
that an extract prepared by boiling the dried powder in water, and evaporating
the decoction, was inert; in fact, the whole of the activity of the
plant resides in a resinous element <em>insoluble</em> in water, and for which I have
proposed the name of <em>Conein</em>. Extract of hemlock, when judiciously
prepared, is a very valuable sedative; I state this from ample experience,
and when combined with Hyoscyamus, and adapted by means of mucilage
and syrup, to the form of a mixture, it affords a more effectual palliative
than any remedy with which I am acquainted, for coughs and pulmonary
irritation. <em>Form. 19.</em> is that from which I have derived the
greatest benefit in such cases. See also <em>Form. 2, 3, 4, 19, 57</em>. Since
the fourth edition of the present work, I requested my friend Dr. John
Davy to make trial of its efficacy in the Military Hospital at Chatham,
and I here introduce his report upon the subject;—“My experience of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>the effects of the <em>Extractum Conii</em> perfectly agrees with that of Dr. Paris,
as stated in the fourth edition of the Pharmacologia, and I am of his opinion
that when properly prepared, and administered, it is a very valuable
sedative; I have given it to the extent daily of from a scruple to a drachm,
in chronic catarrh, and in phthisis pulmonalis, either alone or in conjunction
with the Extract of Hyoscyamus, and it has afforded more relief than
any other medicine that I have tried. From two or three trials of it in
pneumonia, I am disposed to think it may be very serviceable in certain
forms of this disease, in which venesection is contra-indicated by extreme
debility; and also in measles. In the trials alluded to, I commenced giving
it in the large dose of a drachm, daily, suspended in water containing
in solution a grain of <em>Antimonium Tartarizatum</em>. In a very few instances,
where I have from the commencement given it in a large dose, as from ʒj
to ʒiss, it has occasioned hallucination of ideas, which in two cases was
attended with excitement of the sensorium and increased action of the
heart, and in one case, with diminished activity of both. The Extract of
Conium, prepared by Mr. Barry, is the most powerful one I have ever used,
indeed, until I tried it, I had no just idea of the virtues of Conium as a
medicine; but I am now disposed to give credit to Stöerk’s account of its
efficacy in various chronic diseases; and I have no doubt but that this
valuable medicine has fallen into comparative disrepute and disuse from
the bad quality of the extract commonly employed.” Dr. Maton has
found that the value of this extract is greatly increased by including the
seeds in its preparation. <em>Dose</em>, grs. v to ℈j; or more, twice or thrice a day;
in a full dose it produces giddiness, a slight nausea, and a tremor of the
body; a peculiar heavy sensation is also experienced about the eyes; and
the bowels become gently relaxed: unless some of these sensations are
produced, we are never sure that the remedy has had a <em>fair trial</em> of its effects.
Patients will generally bear a larger dose at night than at noon,
and at noon than in the morning.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Extractum Elaterii.</span> L. This substance spontaneously subsides
from the juice of the wild cucumber, in consequence I presume of one of
those series of changes which vegetable matter is perpetually undergoing,
although we are hitherto unable to express them by any known chemical
law. It is therefore not an <em>extract</em>, either in the chemical or pharmaceutical
acceptation of the term, nor an <em>inspissated juice</em>, nor is it a <em>fecula</em>,<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c015'><sup>[502]</sup></a> as it
has been termed; the Dublin College has perhaps been more correct in
simply calling it <em>Elaterium</em>, the name given to it by Dioscorides.</p>

<p class='c007'>It occurs in commerce in little thin cakes, or broken pieces, bearing the
impression of the muslin upon which it has been dried; its <em>colour</em> is
greenish, its <em>taste</em> bitter, and somewhat acrid; and when tolerably pure,
it is light, pulverulent, and inflammable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The early history of this medicinal substance is involved in great perplexity,
each author speaking of a different preparation by the same
name; for instance, the <em>Elaterium</em> of Dioscorides must have been a very
different substance from that of <em>Theophrastus</em>; and, wherever Hippocrates
mentions the term, he evidently alludes to <em>any</em> violent purgative. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hippocrati
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>Elaterium medicamentum est quod per alvum expurgat.</span></i>” (<em>Bod: in
Theophrast</em>.) This will, in some degree, reconcile the discordant testimonies
of different authors with regard to the powers of <em>Elaterium</em>; for example,
Dioscorides states its dose to be from grs. ii to ℈j—in Ætius, Paulus, and
Actuarius, it is recommended to the extent of ʒss—in Mesue from ℈ss to
℈j—in Bontius (<em>Med: Ind:</em>) from ℈j to ʒss—Massarias exhibits it in
doses of gr. vj—Fernelius and Sennertus to ℈j—Herman from grs. v vj—Quincy
to grs. v—and Boerhaave does not venture to give more than gr.
iv—while the practitioners of the present day limit their dose from gr. ½ to
grs. ij. Dr. Clutterbuck, with a laudable intention to discover some method
of procuring this article at a cheaper rate, and at the same time of
establishing some process which might ensure a preparation of more uniform
strength, has lately performed a series of interesting and instructive
experiments,<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c015'><sup>[503]</sup></a> the results of which prove in a satisfactory manner “that
the active principle of this plant is neither lodged in the roots, leaves,
flowers, nor stalks, in <em>any considerable quantity:</em> nor is it to be found in the
body of the fruit itself, or in the seeds, but in <em>the juice around the seeds</em>; the
substance which spontaneously subsides from this liquor, obtained without
pressure, is <em>genuine</em> Elaterium, the quantity of which, contained in the
fruit, is extremely small, for Dr. Clutterbuck obtained only six grains from
<em>forty</em> cucumbers.” This gentleman communicated the detail of these experiments
to the President of the College of Physicians, who requested
me, as professor of Materia Medica, to report upon them. I accordingly
deemed it to be my duty to enter upon a series of new experiments, which
I have lately completed, with the able assistance of Mr. Faraday, in the
laboratory of the Royal Institution. The results of which will shew,
that although Dr. Clutterbuck found that an <em>eighth</em> part of a grain of elaterium
seldom failed to <em>purge violently</em>, yet, strange as it may appear, that
<em>not more than one grain in ten</em> of elaterium, as it occurs in commerce, possesses
any active properties, and that this decimal part is a vegetable
proximate principle, not hitherto noticed, to which I shall give the name
of <span class='sc'>Elatin</span>. I shall subjoin the detail of my experiments, and I think it
will appear that their results will authorise me to express the chemical composition
of Elaterium in the following manner.</p>

<p class='c065'>The solution was intensely bitter, of a brownish yellow colour, and was not in

<p class='c065'>The six grains which were insoluble in water, were treated for forty-eight hours
with alcohol of the specific gravity ·817, at 66° of Fahrenheit; a green solution was
obtained, but by slow evaporation only <em>half a grain</em> of solid green matter was procured.
The insoluble residue obstinately adhered to, and coated the filtre like a
varnish, and completely defended the mass from the action of the alcohol; it is probable

and the residuum washed with successive portions of alcohol, the Elaterium was

<p class='c065'>The residue, insoluble in water, was inflammable, burning with smoke and an
aromatic odour, not in the least bitter; it was soluble in alkalies, and was again precipitated
from them unchanged in colour; it formed, with pure alcohol, a beautiful
tincture, which yielded an odour of a very nauseous kind, but of very little flavour,

gravity, sinking rapidly in water; circumstances which distinguish it from common
resin; in very minute quantities it purges. It appears to be the element in which
the purgative powers of the Elaterium are concentrated, and which I have denominated

<p class='c007'>It appears that the whole of the <em>Elatin</em> does not separate itself from its
native juice by spontaneous subsidence, and that, on this account, the supernatant
liquor possesses some powers as a cathartic. We cannot be
surprised therefore that the <em>Elaterium</em> of commerce should be a very variable
and uncertain medicine; for independent of the great temptation
which its high price holds out for adulterating it, which is frequently done
with starch, it necessarily follows that where the active principle of a compound
bears so small a proportion to its bulk, it is liable to be affected by
the slightest variation in the process for its preparation, and even by the
temperature of the season; where pressure is used for obtaining the juices,
a greater or less quantity of the inactive parts of the cucumber will be
mixed with the <em>Elatin</em>, in proportion to the extent of such pressure, and
the <em>Elaterium</em> will of course be proportionally weak.<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c015'><sup>[504]</sup></a> There is one curious
result obtained in my experiments which deserves notice, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> that
there is a <em>bitter</em> principle in the Elaterium, very distinct from its extractive
matter, and totally unconnected with its activity, for I diluted the solution
obtained in experiment G. and swallowed it, but it produced upon me no
effect, except that which I generally experience upon taking a powerful
bitter,—an increased appetite; and yet notwithstanding this fact, when
in combination with <em>Elatin</em>, it is far from being inert, since this latter body
is considerably quickened by its presence. See page 152. The solution
B was given to a person, but no effect whatever ensued. <em>Dose</em> of good
<em>Elaterium</em>, as it occurs in commerce, is about one grain, or it is better to
give it only to the extent of half a grain at a time, and to repeat that dose
every hour until it begins to operate. It is probably, when thus managed,
the best hydragogue cathartic which we possess; it differs however from
the class of remedies to which it belongs, for it excites the pulse and
whole animal system, so as to produce a considerable degree of febrile action.
It was strongly recommended by Sydenham, Lister, and Hoffman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>and all their cotemporaries and immediate successors, as a valuable remedy
in dropsy; but in consequence of some fatal results from its improper
application, it was driven from practice with a violence that marks
prejudice rather than conviction; one author, in descanting upon its virulence,
exclaims, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Elaterium esse in catalogo diaboli quo necat homines</span></i>.”
For its restoration to medicine, we are indebted to Dr. Ferriar of Manchester,

This preparation has found its way into the London Pharmacopœia, in
consequence of the testimony of many highly respectable practitioners in
favour of its sedative properties. In the memoirs of the Caledonian Horticultural
Society, various suggestions are offered as to the best mode of
obtaining an extract from the milky juice of the garden Lettuce, to which
Dr. Duncan has bestowed the name of “<span class='sc'>Lactucarium</span>;” it was first recommended
to take the milk with cotton, afterwards with a sponge, and
more recently with a painter’s brush; all these methods however are attended
with considerable difficulty, and the juice cannot be collected in any
quantity. Mr. Probart, a chemist in Great Portland Street, has lately
cultivated large plantations of the lettuce, for the purpose of instituting
experiments upon the subject, and I am happy in being enabled through
his liberality, to introduce in this place, an account of the process which
he pursues, and which he considers the only one by which the article
can be brought into the market at any reasonable price.<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c015'><sup>[505]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>In concluding the history of Inspissated juices, it deserves notice that
the London College uniformly directs that the <em>feculence</em> should be preserved
in the compound: there can be no doubt of the propriety of such advice,
but the Colleges of Edinburgh and Dublin reject it. The French
Codex gives directions for two extracts from each of these substances, one
containing what they please to denominate the <em>fecula</em>, the other not; thus
there is “<em>Extractum Cicutæ absque Fecula</em>” and “<em>Extract: Cicut: cum

that most, if not all of them, contain <em>nitre</em>, <em>common salt</em>, and <em>muriate of potass.</em></p>

drachm, two or three times a day, it has proved in his hands a most efficacious
remedy in the cure of <em>Tic doloureux</em>. Mr. Hutchinson is well known
to the profession as a judicious and inquiring practitioner, and we are well
satisfied that he would not recommend any remedy to the attention of his
brethren, without a well grounded assurance of its efficacy; at the same
time it must be remembered that this disease is very frequently the consequence
of an irritation in some nerve, by the mechanical operation of osseous
spiculæ; in such cases we cannot expect the sub-carbonate of Iron to
afford relief. A noble Marquis who lost his leg at Waterloo, suffered excruciating
pains in his face, in consequence of exfoliation in the stump,
which were relieved as soon as the local irritation subsided; and a late lamented
physician appears to have owed his severe sufferings to the irritation
produced on the brain by a bony excrescence. I have little doubt if
cases of <em>Tic doloureux</em> were more carefully examined, they would be frequently
found to derive their origin from a similar source. If it were necessary
I could add several of such instances to those already enumerated.<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c015'><sup>[506]</sup></a></p>

it is a mere mixture of metallic iron with super-tartrate of potass,
coloured by oxide of iron; when however it is made with more care, it
appears to be a double salt, consisting of tartrate of potass and tartrate of
iron; or may it not be one of those combinations which cream of tartar
forms with metals, and of which I have spoken under the article <em>Antimonium

smoke. The root, moreover, contains gallic and acetic acids; uncrystallizable
sugar; tannin; starch; a gelatinous matter insoluble in water

weight of gum. Alcohol takes up one-fifth of its weight, and a golden
yellow tincture results, which has the sensible qualities of the galbanum,
and becomes milky on the addition of water, but no precipitate falls. A

but the impurities. By distillation, galbanum yields half its weight of

and tincture of galls possess habitudes with which it is very important
for the medical practitioner to be acquainted, not only for the purpose of
directing their exhibition with success, but because the elements which
impart to them their characteristic traits, viz. <em>Gallic Acid</em> and <em>Tannin</em>,<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c015'><sup>[512]</sup></a> are
very widely diffused through the products of the vegetable kingdom, and
will be found to be constantly active in their chemical, medicinal, and
pharmaceutical relations. Metallic salts, especially those of iron, produce
precipitates with infusion of galls, composed of tannin, gallic acid, and
the metallic oxide; of these compounds the <em>tanno-gallate of iron</em> is the most
striking, being of a black colour; those of <em>sub-acetate</em> and <em>acetate of lead</em>
are greyish; <em>tartarized antimony</em> produces a yellowish; <em>sulphate of copper</em>
a brown; <em>sulphate of zinc</em> reddish black; <em>nitrate of silver</em>, a deep olive; and
<em>nitrate of mercury</em>, a bright yellow precipitate; the <em>oxy-muriate of mercury</em>
produces only an opacity. <em>Sulphuric acid</em> throws down a yellowish curdy
precipitate, <em>muriatic</em>, a flaky and white one, and <em>nitric acid</em> merely modifies
the colour of the infusion, although it destroys its astringency; the solution
of <em>ammonia</em> occasions no precipitate but renders the colour deeper,
the <em>carbonate</em> however throws down a precipitate; the carbonates of the
<em>fixed alkalies</em> produce a yellowish flaky, and <em>lime water</em> a copious green
precipitate. The <em>tannin</em> in the infusion of galls is precipitated by a solution
of isinglass or of any other animal jelly, by that of starch, and by
many metallic oxides. <span class='sc'>Medicinal Uses.</span> Galls are most powerfully
astringent. The native practitioners of India not only administer them as
astringents in dysentery, but as tonics in cases of intermittent fever.
<span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span> In that of powder; and in combination with
other astringents (<em>Form. 51</em>,) or with aromatics and bitters. As a local
remedy the gall-nut enters into gargles and injections; for <em>blind</em> piles, an
ointment composed of 2½ parts of finely powdered galls, and a small portion
of opium, with three parts of simple ointment as an excipient, offers
a very valuable resource. (<em>Form. 55.</em>) In some cases of hemorrhoids,
prolapsus ani, and fluor albus, the application may be made in the form

An analysis of this root has lately been effected by M. M. Feneulle and
Capron, from which it appears that its active principle, unlike that of the

enter into its composition, viz. 1. A Volatile Oil.—2. A Fatty matter.—3.
A Resin.—4. Wax.—5. A Volatile Acid.—6. A bitter principle.—7.
Mucus.—8. Alumina.—9. Gallate of Potass.—10. Acidulous Gallate

water and alcohol extract its virtues, but the spirituous solution is the most
active; long coction diminishes its powers, hence the watery extract acts
more mildly than the root. <span class='sc'>Medicinal Uses.</span> This is one of the most
ancient articles of the materia medica. Ctesias, who lived in the time of
Plato, and anterior to Hippocrates, speaks of it as a medicine of important
virtues. By the Greek and Roman physicians it was highly esteemed as
a remedy in Mania (<em>see p. 8.</em>) The extraordinary cures performed at the
island of Anticyrus, famous for its Hellebore, are celebrated by the poets
and historians of antiquity. It is a drastic cathartic, and may prove therefore

moreover detected a volatile oil in the Lupulin, amounting to 2 per cent.;
its proportion, however, appears to vary in the Hop of different countries;
the French hop, for instance, has been found to contain more than the
Belgic, but less than the English; Hops, moreover, soon after having
been picked, yield, <em>cæteris paribus</em>, more oil and less resin than the old; a

the oil is capable of being resinified. (<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Pharmacie, Juin 1822.</span></cite>)

of a pleasant bitter combined with a feeble narcotic; the late

but under various forms of preparation, it affords a series of very active remedies.
<span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> With the exception of Peruvian Bark, there
is perhaps no active article in the materia medica more shamefully adulterated;
its impurity is at once indicated by its dull aspect; by its tarnishing,
and becoming covered with a grey film; by its diminished mobility,
in consequence of which its globules are unable to retain the spherical
form, and therefore <em>tail</em>, as it is technically expressed. <em>Lead</em> is discovered
by dissolving it in nitric acid, and adding to the solution water impregnated
with sulphuretted hydrogen, when, if lead be present, a dark brown
precipitate will ensue. <em>Bismuth</em>, by pouring the nitric solution into distilled
water, when it will appear as a white precipitate. <em>Zinc</em>, by exposing
the mercury to heat. <em>Tin</em> is detected by a dilute solution of nitro-muriate
of gold, which throws down a purple precipitate. The presence of lead in
mercury is a most dangerous circumstance; I have once witnessed a case
of <em>cholica pictonum</em> in consequence of it. The usual mode of purifying
quicksilver, by pressing it through chamois leather, will not separate the
lead, if it be, as is generally the case, in combination with bismuth; for the
manner in which the adulteration is effected, is by melting with a gentle
heat these two metals, and adding the alloy to the mercury; and although
this alloy should exceed one-fourth of the whole bulk, it will pass, together
with the mercury, through chamois leather. On standing, the bismuth
will be thrown upon the surface, in the form of a dark powder, but the lead
will remain in solution. The greatest part of the mercury of commerce
comes from Istria and Friuli, and from the Palatinate, and as it passes
through the hands of the Dutch, we must expect to receive it in a state of
alloy. On a superficial examination, it ought not, when shaken with water,
to impart to it any colour; when agitated or digested with vinegar, it
should not communicate a sweetish taste; and when exposed in an iron
spoon to heat, it ought to evaporate entirely. The French are so well
aware of the mischievous extent to which this metal is falsified, that in
their late Codex they direct the reduction of the <em>red oxyd</em> in order to obtain
it; the process however is too expensive for general adoption. The Italian
Jews purify quicksilver for their barometers, by digesting it in dilute sulphuric
acid, which is by no means an improper process. The mode directed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>for the purification of mercury by the London College, (<em>Hydrargyrum
Purificatum</em>) is unable to separate it <em>completely</em> from its more deleterious
contaminations. It is a general opinion in Germany, that mercury, boiled
in water, will impart to it an anthelmintic virtue;<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c015'><sup>[523]</sup></a> this, if it happens, can
only depend upon the impurities of the mercury; but large draughts of
cold water are in themselves anthelmintic. Although metallic mercury
in its fluid form exerts no effect upon the animal system, it, nevertheless,
in a state of vapour, manifests considerable powers; and it is necessary
for the practitioner to be informed that it assumes this condition at the
ordinary temperature of the atmosphere. I have stated several experiments
in proof of this fact in my work on Medical Jurisprudence, <em>Art</em>.

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> <em>Form</em>, a crystalline mass, composed of very small prismatic
crystals, which is easily pulverized, and undergoes a slight alteration
by exposure to air, becoming on its surface opaque and pulverulent.
Light, however, has no effect upon it, although a different opinion has
existed, and it has accordingly been recommended to be kept in black bottles.
<em>Odour</em>, none. <em>Taste</em>, very acrid, with a metallic astringency, occasioning
a sensation of obstruction in the throat which continues for some
time. <em>Sp. gr.</em> 5·1398. When pulverised and thrown upon burning
coals, it is immediately volatilized, giving out a thick white smoke of a
very pungent smell, which irritates the mucous membranes extremely,
and is highly dangerous to those who inhale it. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span>
According to the latest views, it is a <em>Bi-chloride</em> of mercury, consisting
of one proportional of mercury, to two proportionals of chlorine. In
the French codex, it is termed “<em>Deuto-Chloruretum Hydrargyri</em>.” <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span>
It is soluble in eleven parts of cold, and in three of boiling water,
and in half its weight of alcohol; it is also very soluble in æther; indeed
this latter liquid has the curious property of abstracting it from
its solution in water, when agitated with it. Its solubility in water is
greatly increased by the addition of a few drops of rectified spirit, or of muriatic
acid. In a solution of muriate of ammonia it is seventeen times
more soluble than in water, no decomposition however arises; it is therefore
probable that a triple salt is formed; it is also soluble in the sulphuric,
nitric, and muriatic acids, and may be obtained again unaltered, by simply
evaporating the solutions. Dr. Davy, in his late researches upon corrosive
sublimate states that with muriatic acid, common salt, and some other
muriates, it forms definite compounds remarkable for their solubility. Its
watery solution is said to change vegetable blues to green, but this is an
optical fallacy, (<em>see page 306</em>.) On exposure to light this solution slowly
undergoes decomposition; but Dr. Davy has shewn that corrosive sublimate
remains unaltered when exposed in solution in media having a strong
affinity for it, as in alcohol, æther, muriatic acid, &amp;c. and that decomposition
only takes place under circumstances of complicated affinities, as in
the instance of <em>Liquor Hydrargyri Oxymuriatis</em>, and in that of the aqueous
solution; in which cases Calomel and Muriatic acid appear to be formed,
and oxygen to be evolved. <span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span> The <em>carbonates
of the fixed</em> alkalies precipitate it of a yellow hue, but the precipitates are
not pure oxides; <em>ammonia</em> forms with it a white triple compound. <em>Lime
water</em> decomposes it more perfectly than any alkaline body, occasioning a
precipitate of a deep yellow colour,<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c015'><sup>[524]</sup></a> which is a per-oxyd of mercury containing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>a little muriatic acid; this result forms a useful lotion to ill conditioned
ulcers, and has been long known under the title of <em>Aqua Phagadenica</em>;
f℥j of lime water should be employed for the decomposition of two
grains of the salt. <em>Tartarized antimony</em>, <em>nitrate of silver</em>, <em>acetate of lead</em>, <em>sulphur</em>,
<em>sulphuret of potass</em>, and <em>soaps</em>, decompose it. <em>Iron</em>, <em>lead</em>, <em>copper</em>, <em>bismuth</em>,
and <em>zinc</em>, in their metallic state, also decompose it, producing precipitates
which consist of an amalgam of the metal employed, except in
those cases where the metal in question refuses to amalgamate with mercury,
when this latter metal appears as a metallic dew, composed of very
minute globules, with calomel; hence mortars of glass or earthenware
should be used for dispensing this article; when triturated with olive oil,
the oil becomes white, and when boiled with it, <em>calomel</em> is precipitated;
the same happens if sugar be substituted for oil. The volatile oils reduce
it. When Oil of Turpentine was used, some traces of artificial camphor
was discovered by Dr. Davy, and when the oils of Cloves and Peppermint,
a purple compound distilled over, consisting of the oil employed and muriatic
acid. The following vegetable infusions produce precipitates, viz.
<em>the infusions and decoctions of chamomile</em>, <em>horse-radish root</em>, <em>calumba root</em>, <em>catechu</em>,
<em>cinchona</em>, <em>rhubarb</em>, <em>senna</em>, <em>simarouba</em>, <em>oak bark</em>, <em>tea</em> and <em>almond emulsion</em>.
Swediaur observes, that “many authors have recommended <em>sublimate</em>
combined with bark, but that a reciprocal decomposition is thus produced,
by which the energies of both remedies are alike annulled;” to this ignorance,
however, he thinks that many patients have been indebted for their
lives; for, says he, “I see every day examples of weak and very delicate
persons of both sexes, to whom ignorant practitioners prescribe, and sometimes
in very large doses, the <em>corrosive sublimate</em>, with a decoction of bark;
certainly without curing the syphilis, but at the same time without occasioning
those grave and dangerous symptoms, which that acrid medicine
would certainly produce, if given alone, or without that decoction.” We
have here presented the reader with the opinion of Swediaur; but it is just
to state, that the experience of this country has rather tended to subvert,
than to confirm, such a belief. That the corrosive sublimate of mercury is
actually decomposed by the vegetable principles of the bark is sufficiently
evident, but it would seem that the oxide thus developed, and recombined
with vegetable extractive, is a very active mercurial, especially with respect
to its alterative powers. The same observation will, to a certain extent, apply
to the results of its decomposition by other agents; the fixed alkalies
have been found by actual experiment to be incapable of disarming this salt
of its virulence, because, as Orfila has stated, the oxide liberated is, in itself,
an active poison. Mr. Rose has lately transmitted to me a formula for
the preparation of “<em>Alterative Drops</em>,” which he states, from ample experience,
to possess very considerable powers as a mercurial, and to excite
ptyalism, with a quickness and certainty which characterize but few preparations
of the same class. The principal ingredients are an alcoholic
solution of <em>corrosive sublimate</em> and a vinous solution of tartarized antimony.
It is scarcely necessary to observe that upon admixture a mutual decomposition
takes place; the <em>peroxide of mercury</em> is precipitated by the alkaline
element of the antimonial compound, whilst this latter salt, having its affinities
thus overthrown, parts with the <em>protoxide of antimony</em>; so that the
preparation holds a considerable quantity of insoluble matter in suspension,
and which is to be carefully incorporated with the liquid by shaking
the phial, whenever the drops are administered. Now there can be but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>little doubt but that the activity of this preparation is owing to the <em>peroxide
of mercury</em>, thus diffused in a state of minute division, while at the
same time the antimonial protoxide very probably disposes the stomach
and system to be more readily influenced by it, for reasons which have
been fully discussed in the first part of this work, p. 152. <span class='sc'>Med. Uses.</span>
It is one of the most acrid and active of all metallic preparations; in well
directed doses, however, it is frequently of service in secondary syphilis,
and in cases of anomalous disease, when it would be improper to administer
the other forms of mercury.<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c015'><sup>[525]</sup></a> In obstinate cutaneous diseases its administration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>in small doses is often very serviceable; I have, however, seen
extreme emaciation and hectic fever produced by its too long continued
exhibition, although ptyalism was never occasioned. Its application also
as a lotion to leprous affections, in the proportion of about one grain to a
fluid-ounce and a half of some liquid vehicle, I have frequently seen highly
beneficial; in directing the use of so acrid a lotion, we should caution the
patient not to touch his eyes until his hands have been washed; in consequence
of a neglect of this kind I have seen a very severe ophthalmia produced.
The practitioner should also remember that the system may become
affected by such external applications; a case stands recorded in
which a girl of five years old became salivated, and died, in consequence
of an application made to the head for the cure of <em>Tinea</em>, which consisted
of Pomatum rubbed up with a few grains of this salt. Its internal exhibition
should be accompanied with mucilaginous drinks; when an overdose
has been taken, the <em>white</em> of egg, diluted with water, is the best antidote,
for Orfila has found that albumen decomposes it, reducing it to the state of
mild muriate, whilst the compound which it forms with it is inert. Many
examples are recorded of the success of this practice. In the Transactions
of the King and Queen’s College of Physicians in Ireland, an interesting
case of this kind is related by Dr. Lendrick; it is, however, at the same
time but justice to state, that there are instances also of the failure of this
antidote. In the 41st volume of the <em>London Medical and Physical Journal</em>,
p. 204, the reader will find the case of a girl, who was poisoned by a
drachm of Sublimate, and who, notwithstanding the copious ingestion of
albumen, died in ninety hours. More recently vegetable gluten, as existing
in wheat-flower, is said to answer as well as albumen; for the administration
of which all that is required is to give wheat-flower and water.

<span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> It ought to be volatilized by heat; it is frequently met
with in commerce contaminated with muriate of iron, sometimes with arsenic;
the presence of calomel is at once discovered from its insolubility.
<span class='sc'>Tests of its Presence.</span> If any powder be suspected to contain this salt,
expose it to heat in a coated tube, as directed in the treatment of arsenic,
but without any carbonaceous admixture, when corrosive sublimate, if
present, will rise and line the interior surface with a shining white crust.
This crust is then to be dissolved in distilled water, and assayed by the
following tests; 1st, <em>lime water</em> will produce, if the suspected solution
contains this salt, a precipitate of an orange yellow colour. 2d, a single
drop of a dilute solution of <em>sub-carbonate of potass</em> will at first produce
a white precipitate, but on a still farther addition of the test, an
orange-coloured sediment will be formed. 3rd, <em>sulphuretted water</em> will
throw down a dark coloured precipitate, which when dried and strongly
heated may be volatilized without any alliaceous odour. 4th, <em>ammonia</em>
produces a white precipitate, which is an insoluble triple salt, composed
of muriatic acid, ammonia, and oxide of mercury, which, on being
heated, grows yellow; it passes afterwards to a red, and gives out ammoniacal
gas, nitrogen, calomel, and metallic mercury. In this operation the
oxide is supposed to be decomposed by the hydrogen which results from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>portion of the ammonia. 5th, <em>Nitrate of tin</em>, according to Dr. Bostock, is
capable of detecting the three-millionth part of a grain; a single drop will
occasion an immediate and copious dark-brown precipitate. All the above
precipitates, if rubbed on a bright plate of copper, will render its surface
very white. Where the salt is mixed with various coloured liquids, we
must proceed as directed under the head of Arsenic. A very ingenious
application of galvanic electricity has been also proposed by Mr. Silvester,
for the detection of <em>corrosive sublimate</em>, which will exhibit the mercury in a
metallic state. A piece of zinc or iron wire about three inches in length,
is to be twice bent at right angles, so as to resemble the Greek letter <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Π</span>, the
two legs of this figure should be distant about the diameter of a common
gold wedding ring from each other, and the two ends of the bent wire must
afterwards be tied to a ring of this description. Let a plate of glass, not
less than three inches square, be laid as nearly horizontal as possible, and
on one side drop some sulphuric acid, diluted with about six times its
weight of water, till it spreads to the size of a halfpenny. At a little distance
from this, towards the other side, next drop some of the solution supposed
to contain corrosive sublimate, till the edges of the two liquids become
joined; and let the wire and ring, prepared as above, be laid in such
a way that the wire may touch the acid, while the gold ring is in contact
with the suspected liquid. If the minutest quantity of corrosive sublimate
be present, the ring in a few minutes will be covered with mercury on the
part which touched the fluid. This experiment may be beautifully simplified
in the following manner; drop a small quantity of solution containing
corrosive sublimate on a piece of gold, and bring into contact a key, or
some piece of iron, so as to form a galvanic circuit, when the gold will be
immediately whitened. A solution of nitrate of silver will, under similar
circumstances, occasion on the gold a white precipitate, but as no amalgamation
takes place, it is readily wiped off, and cannot possibly occasion
any fallacy.<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c015'><sup>[526]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Certain metals likewise decompose solutions of this salt, by virtue of
superior affinity; in those cases where the precipitating metal is capable
of forming a direct union with Mercury, we shall find the precipitates to
consist of an amalgam of the metal employed; where no such combination
takes place, the mercury will be frequently seen standing on the surface
as a metallic dew. This is particularly striking where iron or steel
has been employed; these metals are also at the same time blackened by it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brugnatelli<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c015'><sup>[527]</sup></a> has proposed the following method of distinguishing <em>corrosive
sublimate</em> from <em>arsenic</em>—Take a quantity of fresh wheat starch, mix
with water, and add a sufficient quantity of <em>iodine</em> to give the liquid a blue
colour; if <em>corrosive sublimate</em> or <em>arsenic</em> be added to this liquor, the colour is
alike destroyed and it becomes reddish, but if the change has been effected
by the latter substance, a few drops of sulphuric acid will restore the blue
colour, but if by the former it is not recoverable by such means.<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c015'><sup>[528]</sup></a></p>

but as much a <em>muriate</em> as the corrosive sublimate; the only difference depending
upon the degree of oxidizement of the mercury, which is at a <em>minimum</em>
in calomel, and at a <em>maximum</em> in sublimate. According to the new
views respecting chlorine, calomel must consist of one proportional of chlorine
with one proportional of metal, and is therefore a <em>chloride of mercury</em>.

Calomel by universal consent is adopted for such a purpose. (<em>Form.

as it is called, is a peculiar art practised by persons in this town, who gain
a very good livelihood by it; they engage to return the same weight of
isinglass in shreds, as they receive in <em>Staple</em>; this in itself secures very fair
profit, for by damping the isinglass in order to pick it, it gains considerable
weight; these persons moreover are in the habit of adulterating it with
pieces of bladder, and the dried skin of soles; such frauds however are
easily detected by their insolubility, for pure isinglass will dissolve entirely,
and yield a clear and transparent jelly; a single grain will produce, with
an ounce of water, a solution of considerable thickness; it is also soluble in
acids and alkalies; and although insoluble in alcohol, yet it is not precipitated
by it from its watery solutions, unless when added in a very considerable
quantity; it is coagulated by the infusions and decoctions of
vegetable astringents; <em>carbonate of potass</em> likewise throws down a precipitate.

    <div>INFUSA. L.E.D. <em>Infusion.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These are <em>watery</em> solutions of vegetable matter, obtained by maceration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>either in cold or hot<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c015'><sup>[536]</sup></a> water without the assistance of ebullition. In selecting
and conducting the operation, the following general rules should be
observed.</p>

<p class='c047'>I. <em>Infusion should always be preferred to decoction, where the medicinal virtues
of the vegetable substance reside in volatile oil, or in principles
which are easily soluble; whereas, if they depend upon resino-mucilaginous
particles, decoction is an indispensable operation.</em></p>

<p class='c047'>II. <em>The temperature employed must be varied according to the circumstances
of each case;<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c015'><sup>[537]</sup></a> an infusion made in the cold, is in general
more grateful, but less active, than one made with heat.</em></p>

<p class='c047'>III. <em>The duration of the process must likewise be regulated by the nature
of the substances, or the intention of the prescriber; for the infusion
will differ according to the time in which the water has been digested
on the materials; thus, the aroma of the plant is first taken up, then,
in succession, the colouring, astringent, and gummy parts.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Infusions are liable to undergo decompositions by being kept, and
therefore, like decoctions, they must be regarded as <em>extemporaneous</em> preparations.
Unless the dose of them be otherwise stated, it is generally from
f℥j to f℥ij.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Infusum Quassiæ.</span> L.E. The proportion of Quassia directed for half
a pint of water, is that of ℈j by the London, and ʒss by the Edinburgh

infusion, ʒij are required for that quantity of water. <em>Incompatibles.</em> <em>The

with which it is likely to come in contact in a medical prescription.
It is highly useful in debilities of the stomach and intestinal canal, and in
irregular and atonic gout, and it has been observed, that in hysterical
atony, to which the female sex is so prone, the Quassia affords more
vigour and relief to the system, than the Peruvian Bark, especially when
combined with a small portion of sulphate of zinc. To this, as well as the
other stomachic infusions, it is usual to add at the time of prescribing them
a small quantity of aromatic tincture or spirit. <em>Form. 35; 144.</em> Dose,

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Infusum Rhei.</span> L.E. The Edinburgh infusion is stronger than that
of London, and is rendered more grateful by the addition of spirit of cinnamon;
these infusions, however, when given without any <em>adjuvants</em>, produce

of sitting easily on the stomach. Dose, f℥j-f℥iss.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Infusum Catechu Compositum.</span> L.E. This infusion is a powerful
astringent, rendered grateful by the addition of cinnamon; it will keep for
several months, provided the directions of the Edinburgh College be not
followed in adding the syrup. In prescribing it, we must remember that
it contains a large proportion of <em>tannin</em>. See <em>Catechu</em>. Dose, f℥j-f℥iij.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Infusum Gentianæ Compositum.</span> L. An elegant tonic and stomachic
infusion. It affords a good example of the virtues of a natural
substance being enhanced by the additions of art, as discussed at page
164, for the bitterness of the gentian is here subdued by the aromatic
quality of the lemon and orange peel. <em>Incompatibles.</em> <em>Acetate of lead</em> throws
down a copious precipitate from the infusion, and <em>sulphate of iron</em> strikes a
brown colour, but no precipitate takes place for several hours.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Infusum Rosæ Compositum.</span> L.E.D. This is an infusion of the petals
of the red rose, rendered astringent and refrigerant,<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c015'><sup>[538]</sup></a> by the addition of
dilute sulphuric acid. By referring to the <span class='sc'>Dynameter</span>, it will be seen
that f℥j; does not contain more than four and a half minims of <em>dilute</em> acid,
which are equivalent to three-sevenths of a minim of the strong <em>concentrated</em>
acid. Wherever therefore we expect any advantage from this latter ingredient,
the quantity must be increased by extemporaneous addition. <em>Incompatibles.</em>
All those bodies which are decomposed by the sulphuric acid;
the <em>sulphates of iron</em> and <em>zinc</em> do not immediately alter the infusion, but they
<em>slowly</em> decompose it, producing precipitates of a dark colour. Dr. Clarke
of Cambridge detected <em>iron</em> in the petals;<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c015'><sup>[539]</sup></a> may not the presence of this
metal enhance the tonic powers of the infusion? It affords a most elegant
vehicle for the exhibition of cathartic salts.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Infusum Sennæ Compositum.</span> L.E.D. A pint of water will take up
the active matter of ℥j of senna, but nothing beyond that proportion;
hence there is an unnecessary waste in the London process. The quantity
of infusion directed to be made at one time, is also injudicious, since by
simple exposure to the air for only a few hours, in consequence of the
powerful affinity of its extractive matter for oxygen, a yellow precipitate
takes place, and the infusion loses its purgative quality, and excites <em>tormina</em>
in the bowels; in preparing it therefore, we see the necessity of conducting
the process in <em>covered</em> vessels, and of making only such a portion as may
be required for immediate use; indeed, notwithstanding every precaution,
the extractive will to a certain extent become oxidized, and the infusion
have a tendency to gripe.<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c015'><sup>[540]</sup></a> Dr. Cullen used to say that Senna was one
of the best purgatives, if it could only be divested of its griping quality; this
however he was unable to obviate, because he was not aware of its cause,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>and therefore conjoined it with various aromatics, instead of those salts<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c015'><sup>[541]</sup></a>
which might be capable of increasing the solubility of its oxidized extractive,
or the purgative activity of the infusion; see page 150, and 161.
<em>Soluble tartar</em> and <em>alkaline salts</em> are its most useful adjuncts; it is however
rarely prescribed in practice without the addition of other cathartics.
(<em>Form. 70, 76, 90.</em>) Sydenham’s favourite “<em>potio cathartica lenitiva</em>,” consisted
of an infusion of tamarinds, senna leaves, and rhubarb, with the addition
of manna and syrup of roses. The addition of tamarinds renders the
infusion more grateful but less active; when made with <em>bohea tea</em>, it is in a
great degree deprived of its nauseous taste; a decoction of guaiacum increases
its powers, and is said at the same time to render it milder. Bitters
also very considerably exalt its efficacy, see page 153. A pint of the
infusion with a drachm of jalap forms an excellent combination for a purgative
enema. <em>Incompatibles.</em> The infusion is disturbed by <em>strong acids</em>;
<em>lime water</em>; <em>nitrate of silver</em>; <em>oxy-muriate of mercury</em>; <em>acetate of lead</em>; <em>tartarized
antimony</em>; and by an <em>infusion of yellow cinchona</em>. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, f℥j-f℥ij.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> <em>Form</em>, tortuous pieces of the thickness of a goose-quill, surrounded
by numerous prominent rings, separated by deep grooves. This
root, when powdered, has a faint disagreeable <em>odour</em>, and a bitter sub-acrid
<em>taste</em>. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> The late researches of M. M. Majendie
and Pelletier have detected the existence of a new vegetable proximate
principle in this root, to which ipecacuan is indebted for its emetic properties;
they have, accordingly, denominated it <em>Emetine</em>.<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c015'><sup>[543]</sup></a> It assumes the
form of transparent brownish red scales, which are nearly inodorous, but
have a slightly bitter, acrid, but not nauseous taste. <em>Emetine</em> is decomposed
by a heat higher than that of boiling water; it is insoluble in water,
in every proportion, without undergoing the least change; and in a moist
atmosphere it deliquesces; it is also soluble in alcohol, but not in æther;
<em>nitric acid</em> dissolves it, but at the same time decomposes it; <em>dilute sulphuric
acid</em> has no action on it; <em>muriatic acid</em> and <em>phosphoric acid</em> dissolve it, without
altering its nature; <em>acetic acid</em> dissolves it with great facility; <em>corrosive
sublimate</em> precipitates it from its solutions, but <em>tartarized antimony</em> has no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>effect upon them; <em>gallic acid</em>, the <em>infusion of galls</em>, and <em>acetate of lead</em>, precipitate
it. A grain excites violent vomiting, followed by sleep, and the
patient awakes in perfect health! It exerts also a specific action on the
lungs and mucous membrane of the intestinal canal; when taken in an
overdose, its action can be instantly paralysed by a decoction of galls.
There seems to be no great advantage in substituting this body for the ordinary
powder of Ipecacuanha, except perhaps that its taste being much
less offensive, it may very easily be given to children.<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c015'><sup>[544]</sup></a> <em>Emetine</em> appears
to exist in Ipecacuanha, combined in the following manner, <em>emetine</em> 16,
oils 2, wax 6, gum 10, starch 40, woody fibre 20.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since the discovery of <em>Emetine</em>, whose properties are described above,
Pelletier has extended his researches into its composition and nature; and
he has lately been enabled to state that this body, which in conjunction
with Majendie, he had formerly announced as “a new vegetable proximate
principle,” turns out to be a compound of a peculiar alkaline basis,
which may be called <em>Emeta</em>, and some acid, together with an admixture of
colouring matter; when compared with <em>Emetine</em>, it is what white crystallized
sugar is to moist sugar. Its ultimate elements are oxygen, hydrogen
and carbon; it is a white and friable substance, and unlike Emetin, is
not altered by exposure to air; it is slightly bitter, and very sparingly soluble
in water; with the mineral acids it forms salts, from whose solutions
the infusion of galls throws down white and flocculent precipitates; the alcoholic
solution of <em>Emeta</em> acts upon vegetable colour as an alkali.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Medicinal Uses of Ipecacuan.</span> It is unquestionably the most valuable
of the vegetable emetics, and in cases where the stomach is irritable
it is to be preferred to Tartarized Antimony, and it is also less liable to act
upon the bowels. In the form of decoction (made by boiling three drachms
of the bruised root in a quart of water down to a pint) it has been found
serviceable as an enema in Dysentery, and internal piles. <span class='sc'>Incompatible
Substances.</span> All vegetable astringents, as <em>infusion of galls</em>, &amp;c. <em>vegetable
acids</em>, especially the <em>acetic</em>, weaken its power; Dr. Irvine found that grs.
xxx, administered in f℥ij of vinegar, produced only some loose stools.
<span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span> The form of powder is most energetic, although
the vinous solution is both active and convenient. <span class='sc'>Dose.</span> The medicinal
operation of this substance varies with its dose, thus grs. x to ʒss act as an
emetic; (<em>Form: 65</em>,) grs. j to ij, as an expectorant, (<em>Form: 134, 138</em>,)and
in still smaller doses it proves stomachic and diaphoretic; by combination
with opium, this latter quality becomes more powerful, (<em>Form: 28,
130</em>.) The primary effect of this medicine is that of stimulating the stomach,
and it is equally obvious that its secondary ones depend on the numerous
sympathies of other parts with the organs of digestion. The
action of this remedy upon the pulmonary organs is extremely interesting;
it would seem that in certain conditions of these organs, attended with a
dry, hard cough, it promotes expectoration, while in affections attended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>with an inordinate secretion of mucus, it as certainly represses it, and acts
the part of an astringent. In dysentery, and chronic diarrhœa, its astringent
power is also very decided. <em>Form: 58</em>. When combined with cathartics
it aids and accelerates their operation; <em>Form: 84</em>. In Hemorrhage
from the lungs and uterus, it is decidedly useful, when administered<a id='t403'></a> in such
doses as to excite a slight degree of nausea, by which the force of the circulation
is controlled; I have usually combined it, for such a purpose, with
the Acetate of lead in Hæmopthysis; and Bergius relates a case of violent
uterine hæmorrhage which was successfully treated by giving half a grain
every half hour. In certain forms of Dyspepsia it proves highly beneficial,
when administered as proposed by Daubenton, in doses just sufficient
to excite a slight sensation of vermicular motion of the stomach, without
carrying it to the point of nausea, which may be generally effected by half
a grain three times a day. Its peculiar nauseous taste is completely covered
by the addition of powdered Gum Arabic. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> Alcohol
takes up four parts in twenty of Ipecacuan; proof spirit six and a half;
and boiling water rather more than eight parts; one pint of good sherry
wine will dissolve about 100 grains; the alcoholic is more emetic than the
aqueous solution; decoction destroys the emetic property of the root.

light. The root is refractory, and is reduced to powder with difficulty, unless
a few drops of oil, or an almond or two, be previously added. It is a
curious fact that the effluvia of this root occasion in some persons the most
distressing sensations of suffocation. I am acquainted with a lady, who
is constantly seized with a violent dyspnœa, whenever the powder of
Ipecacuan is brought into her presence. <span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> There are

sixteen per cent. of emetin; 2, the <em>grey variety</em>, with fourteen per cent. of
emetin; 3, the <em>white variety</em>, with only five of emetin. The two former varieties
are those usually met with, being imported into this country in bales
from Rio Janeiro; the brown is distinguished from the grey, in being more
wrinkled; the white variety has no wrinkles whatever. We are informed
by Decandolle that the genuine root is frequently mixed with those of

but for such a purpose it will answer better in combination, as in <em>Form. 73</em>.
Its action is said to be promoted by the addition of Ipecacuan, or tartarized
antimony. (<em>Form. 84.</em>) In dropsy its union with super-tartrate of potass
is calculated to promote its beneficial operation. <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span>

render its operation much milder, and the Prussian Pharmacopœia contains
a formula for such a combination, which is said to operate mildly and
promptly. To this preparation the name <span class='sc'>Sapo Jalapinus</span><a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c015'><sup>[546]</sup></a> is given.

The effect of water upon this vegetable substance is materially

practitioner at once abandoned its use in disgust, and it fell into unmerited
disrepute. It would be idle to speak of its specific effects in phthisis; but,
as a demulcent, it is certainly very superior to the mucilaginous mixtures
in ordinary use, and its simple bitter principle at the same time tends to
produce a tonic effect, which is frequently desirable in the debilitated condition
which characterizes the latter stages of this disease. There are circumstances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>however, which may render the removal of the bitter advantageous;

D. Sir Alexander Crichton has offered some observations upon the genuineness
of this article which deserve attention. He says that there are

yields a bitter mucilage. It is that which comes from Iceland, Norway,
Sweden, and Finland. The inferior kind has a membranous texture, and
yields little bitter or mucilage in comparison with the former. Where it
comes from he knows not, but he suspects it to be British, as it is much

<p class='c007'>Its use in making saline draughts has been already noticed, see <em>Acid.
Citric.</em> Its principal medicinal value consists in its antiscorbutic<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c015'><sup>[549]</sup></a> virtues;
indeed it may be fairly asserted that this disease, so peculiarly incident to
a sea life, has been nearly eradicated by the juice of lemons. Sir Gilbert
Blane, in speaking of its efficacy, asserts that “those only who have made
themselves acquainted with the early part of the Naval history of this
country, or those who have perused the interesting, popular, and eloquent
narrative of Commodore Anson’s voyage, can duly appreciate the value
of this simple remedy.” Lemonade, as a beverage in putrid diseases, was
first introduced by the French physicians in the beginning of the 17th century,
and about the year 1660, an Italian from Florence, having learnt a
process of freezing confectionary, conceived the happy idea of converting
such beverage into ice. This found a ready sale, and was the occasion of
so great an increase in the number of sellers of Lemonade, that in the year
1676, the <em>Lemonadiers</em> of Paris were formed into a company, and received
a patent from the government.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cortex</span>—<span class='sc'>The Rind or Peel</span> is composed of two distinct parts; the

indigestible. The flavour may be obtained by rubbing lump sugar upon
it, which will imbibe the oil, and if it be then dried by a very gentle heat,
may be preserved unimpaired for any length of time, and will be preferable
to the volatile oil obtained by distillation, for the fire generally imparts an

<p class='c007'>This preparation is a solution of the neutral <em>acetate of ammonia</em>, with a
proportion of carbonic acid diffused through it; it is made by saturating
the sub-carbonate of ammonia with distilled vinegar, for which purpose
it will generally be found that ℥j of the alkali will saturate oiss of the
vinegar; since, however, the quantity of acid in distilled vinegar as well
the strength of the ammonia, are liable to constant variation, the exact
point of neutralization should be ascertained by the alternate application
of litmus and turmeric papers; for if the proportions be not accurately
adjusted, some of the metallic salts, especially those of <em>antimony</em>, which
are often prescribed in conjunction with it, are decomposed, and thus rendered
inefficacious; and on this account an excess of alkali is to be feared
more than that of acid. This preparation is also not unfrequently employed
as a collyrium, when much serious mischief may arise from the
carbonate of ammonia predominating. It has been already stated that a
very minute proportion of extractive matter is rendered sensible on the
addition of an alkali; hence this preparation frequently derives from the
vinegar a brown hue, which may be removed by filtering the solution
through a little well burnt charcoal. It also deserves notice that the presence
of a trace of copper, derived from the copper cocks through which
the vinegar has passed, will impart a <em>brown</em> tinge, whilst in larger quantities
this metal yields a <em>blue</em> colour with ammonia. <span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span>

upon the presence of the carbonic acid diffused through the solution,
which decomposes the salt and forms an insoluble carbonate of lead.
<em>Magnesia</em> likewise, contrary to what might be supposed, decomposes the
solution and renders it pungent, from the extrication of ammoniacal gas;
this phenomenon depends upon the magnesia forming a triple acetate
with one part of the ammonia, and setting the remainder at liberty. <span class='sc'>Med.

in leucorrhæa, in the last stages of dysentery, and in protracted diarrhœa.
It dissolves also the slimy mucus with which disordered bowels
are so generally infested; on account of this latter property, it has been

circumstances, and it is not liable to produce that irritability of stomach
which frequently attends the long continued use of the fixed alkalies. It
also frequently forms the basis of astringent gargles. Lime water moreover
affords a successful remedy in certain cutaneous affections, particularly
those affecting the face, as <em>Gutta Rosea</em>. Sir G. Blane has also seen

it should not certainly be applied to such as are recent, nor to those whose
character indicates a diminished state of vitality in the parts, and exhibits
a disposition to gangrene. The abuse of Saturnine lotions has been
frequently descanted upon by foreign writers, and, among the evils which
are supposed to be thus induced, impotence is mentioned as one of not
unfrequent occurrence. See <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Institutioni di Medicina Forens</span></cite>: <em>di Tortosa,

the <em>Sphincter Ani</em>, by freely using Goulard’s lotion for the cure of the Piles.
The value of Saturnine<a id='t414'></a> applications in common inflammation most probably
arises from a partial paralysis of the nerves of the part, produced by the

agency; these contradictory results are at length capable of explanation,
for Chemistry has drawn aside the veil that has so long obscured
the history, origin, and cure of calculous diseases, and has demonstrated
that these extraneous bodies vary in composition, and are consequently very
differently affected by the same chemical solvents; but this subject has
already been so fully discussed in the first part of this work, under the

upon it in this place.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has also been found highly useful in the cure of several species of cutaneous

he observes that it seems to be a mechanical mixture of carbonate of magnesia,
caustic magnesia, and perhaps of hydrated magnesia; he found too
great a diversity in its composition to permit the conclusion that it was a
definite chemical compound; in a specimen purchased at Glasgow, he
also found six per cent. of <em>sulphate of lime</em>. I take this opportunity of
stating that in some specimens which I have examined, I have also detected
portions of <em>gypsum</em>; and from the experiments of Dr. Percival, it appears
that if <em>hard water</em> be employed for its preparation it will be less light,

absorption equivocal; its beneficial operation must therefore principally
depend upon its neutralizing any excess of acid in the primæ viæ, and in
this way there can be no doubt of its lithonthryptic agency; “but,” says
Dr. Marcet, “such is the tendency which the public has to over-rate the
utility of a new practice, or to take a mistaken view of its proper application,
that there is every reason to believe that the use of magnesia has of

<em>Sulphate of Soda</em> is often substituted for this salt, which it may be
made to resemble by stirring it briskly at the moment when it is about to
crystallize; the fraud may be detected by a precipitation not ensuing on
adding carbonate of potass; if only a part of the salt be sulphate of soda,
the degree of sophistication can be learnt by the quantity of the precipitate
formed; 100 parts of sulphate of magnesia, if pure, will yield between 30
and 40 of the dry carbonate. Epsom salt, as it commonly occurs, contains
<em>muriate of magnesia</em>, which disposes it to deliquesce, but lately this salt has
appeared in the market in a state of great purity and beauty; the mode of
purification is founded upon the well known chemical law, that <em>a saturated
solution of one salt is still capable of dissolving another</em>; in the present instance,
therefore, the impure crystals are washed in a saturated solution of
the same sulphate, which, although unable to act upon its kindred salt,
can dissolve with facility the muriate, and any other saline contamination.
I confess, however, that I am induced to regard this process as rather
chemically ingenious than as medicinally useful, for the usual saline impurities
of Epsom salt are not only harmless, but capable of increasing its
purgative powers; the <em>double refined</em> sulphate is certainly less efficient as
a cathartic. The presence of the <em>muriate</em> may be at once detected by dropping
upon the suspected sample some sulphuric acid, by which the disengagement
of muriatic acid vapour will be produced. Since the publication
of the fourth edition of the present work, I have received samples of
the sulphate of Magnesia, prepared by Mr. West of Lymington, and I can
confidently recommend the article to the profession; he contrives to obtain
them in large and beautiful crystals, which cannot be so easily mistaken
for those of oxalic acid, a circumstance of no small importance to the
drug vender; the form of these crystals is that of a square prism, having
its edges replaced, and commonly terminated by a pyramid of four planes;
the only cleavage is parallel to one of the diagonals of the prism. The numerous
accidents which so frequently occur from mistaking Oxalic acid
for Epsom Salts have given rise to many suggestions for obtaining an easy
and popular test which may at once distinguish these bodies; it is evident
that no test can be so simple as that afforded by the taste; but if such accidents
are in future to be prevented, it must be done by imparting to the
acid some external character by which it may be at once recognised; if a
test were even discovered a hundred times more sensible than any which
we possess, what would it avail?</p>

a way very similar to the Spigelia Marylandica, producing not unfrequently
confusion of the head, stupor, trembling of the hands, &amp;c. This
is particularly the case if it be used in the months of March and April,
when the sap rises in the tree. It is chiefly against the round worm that
the Melia has been found successful, though in some cases it has proved
effectual also against the Tænia. It is generally given in the form of decoction:
to prepare this, ℥iij or ℥iv of the bark of the fresh root are put
into a quart of water and boiled down to a pint, of which ℥ss to ℥j may

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mistura Ammoniaci.</span> L. This mixture is expectorant, and may be
exhibited with tincture of squills, &amp;c. (<em>Form. 115, 136.</em>) It is slightly
curdled by <em>vinegar</em>, <em>oxymel</em>, <em>æther</em>, and <em>oxy-muriate of mercury</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mistura Amygdalarum.</span> L. <em>Emulsio Amygdali communis</em>. E. <em>Lac

this mixture; <em>tartaric acid</em>, <em>super-tartrate of potass</em>, and <em>oxy-muriate of
mercury</em>, also disturb it. <em>Form. 137.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mistura Assafœtidæ</span>. L. A nauseous preparation; and where its
use is indicated, it will be more judicious to prescribe it as an extemporaneous
mixture. See <em>Assafœtida</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mistura Camphoræ</span>. L. This solution of camphor forms an elegant
vehicle for more active stimulants. The camphor is separated from the
water by a solution of pure potass, by sulphate of magnesia, and by several
saline bodies. See <em>Form. 7, 24, 25, 32, 47, 72, 116, 117, 123</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mistura Cornu Usti</span>. L. <em>Decoctum Cornu Cervini</em>. D. This is nothing
more than a simple diffusion of phosphate of lime in a thin mucilage—<em>Cui

the opinion of some experienced practitioners.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span><span class='sc'>Mistura Cretæ</span>. L.D. A common and useful remedy in diarrhœa,
and may be combined with opium, catechu, or any other astringent.
<em>Form. 52.</em> It is of course incompatible with acids, and acidulous salts.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mistura Ferri Composita.</span> L. This is nearly the same as the celebrated
anti-hectic mixture of Dr. Griffith; to the result of the decompositions
which take place from the mixture of its ingredients, it is wholly
indebted for its medicinal energies; thus, a <em>proto-carbonate of iron</em> is formed,
i. e. the iron combined with carbonic acid is at its <em>minimum</em> of oxidation,
which renders it more active than the common carbonate, and probably
less stimulant than the sulphate; this product, by means of the saponaceous
compound formed by the union of the myrrh with the excess of
alkali, is <em>partly</em> diffused and suspended in the mixture, and <em>partly</em> dissolved,
whilst at the same time a <em>sulphate of potass</em> is formed, which serves to
correct the astringent influence which iron is apt to exert upon the bowels.
The iron in this preparation is disposed to combine with an additional proportion
of oxygen, hence its ingredients should be quickly mixed together,
and it ought to be considered as an extemporaneous preparation, and be
preserved in a closely-stopt vessel. Its change of colour will generally
indicate its loss of efficacy. This preparation must be regarded as permanently
serviceable in Chlorosis, and the numerous sympathetic affections
connected with it. In the painful swellings which infest the breasts of
chlorotic young women, I have found it almost a specific. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, f℥j-f℥ij.
The proportion of <em>Proto-carbonate of iron</em>, contained in any given
quantity of this mixture, may be found by referring to the Medicinal Dynameter;
for instance, bring the preparation to 12, and we shall perceive
that this number of fluid-drachms contain 1 grain of <em>Protoxide</em>, or rather
more than gr. iss of <em>Proto-carbonate</em> of iron; and we shall, at the same
time, perceive that to give an equivalent quantity in the form of <em>Pil. Ferri
comp</em>. we must prescribe ℈j. See <em>Form. 96</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mistura Moschi.</span> This is an eligible form for the administration of

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> <em>Form</em>, grains concreted together, dry, yet slightly unctuous.
<em>Colour</em>, deep brown with a shade of red; <em>Odour</em>, aromatic, peculiar,
diffusive, and durable; and it has the curious property, when added in a
minute quantity, to augment the odour of other perfumes without imparting
its own; this renders it a valuable article in perfumery, on which account
it is a usual ingredient in lavender water. <em>Taste</em>, bitterish and
heavy. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> Resin combined with volatile oil, and
a mucilaginous extractive matter, with small portions of albumen, gelatine,

Stimulant and antispasmodic. As early as the time of Meade it was
employed in typhus fever; Pringle administered it in gout of the stomach,
a practice which received the concurrence of Cullen; conjoined with ammonia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>it has been celebrated for its powers in arresting the progress of
gangrene, and of imparting fresh excitement to the nervous system. It
has been also administered with success in epilepsy, hooping cough, and
other spasmodic affections. <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span> The best form is
that of bolus, combined with ammonia or camphor, or some other similar
remedy, (<em>Form. 21</em>); it may be also administered in a mixture, for which
purpose it requires five times its weight of mucilage, consequently the London
College has not directed a sufficient quantity to retain the musk in suspension:
by previously triturating it with sugar, its minute division is
much facilitated. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, grs. x to xxx. See <em>Form. 22, 30</em>. <span class='sc'>Officinal
Prep.</span> <em>Mist. Mosch</em>. L. <em>Tinct. Mosch</em>. D. <span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> The bag
containing the musk should have no appearance of having been opened:
the presence of <em>dried blood</em> may be suspected, by its emitting, as it inflames,
a fetid smoke; <em>Asphaltum</em> is discovered by its melting and running before
it inflames: the artificial bags are known from the deficiency of the membrane
which lines the real musk bags. To increase the weight of the
musk, fine particles of lead are frequently added; this is easily detected,
for by rubbing it with water the metallic particles will subside.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Moschus Factitius.</span> <em>Artificial Musk</em>, strongly resembling the real,
may be formed by digesting f℥ss of <em>Nitric Acid</em>, for ten days, upon ℥j of
fetid animal oil, obtained by distillation; to this is to be next gradually
added oj of <em>rectified spirit</em>, and the whole is then to be left to digest for one
month: or—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This preparation consists of one part of gum and two of water; in preparing
it, the dispenser is particularly recommended to pulverize the gum,
and never to employ that which is purchased in the state of powder, as it
is always impure and incapable of forming a pellucid and elegant solution.<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c015'><sup>[564]</sup></a>
<span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span> Neither the <em>strong acids</em> nor <em>alcohol</em>,
when considerably diluted, occasion any disturbance in it; but <em>sulphuric
æther</em> and its <em>compound spirit</em>, <em>the tincture of muriated iron</em>, and <em>sub-acetate of
lead</em>, produce very dense precipitates: the <em>acetate of lead</em> only occasions
decomposition, when an alkaline salt is present in the formula; the <em>volatile
alkali</em> curdles the mucilage, and <em>hard calcareous waters</em> render the mixture
difficult and often impracticable. In the pharmaceutical application
of this mucilage, it should be remembered that it contains in its composition
an astringent principle, which is perhaps of but trifling consequence
except in the exhibition of some very few active metallic salts, which are
certainly decomposed by it (e. g. grs. x of <em>nitrate of mercury</em> are decomposed
by ʒij of gum arabic.<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c015'><sup>[565]</sup></a>) It contains also lime in combination with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>some vegetable acid. <span class='sc'>Uses.</span> Diluted with four times its bulk of water,
this mucilage forms a demulcent mixture of appropriate tenacity, which
affords a convenient vehicle for several efficient remedies; the pharmaceutical
use of this mucilage depends upon the fact of its rendering expressed
and essential oils, balsams, resins, gum-resins, resinous tinctures, and fatty
bodies, miscible with water, but if a syrup be added, the union will be more
perfect; the proportions necessary for this purpose vary according to the
nature of the substances; thus, <em>oils</em> will require about three-fourths their
weight, <em>Balsams</em> and <em>Spermaceti</em> an equal part, <em>Resins</em> a double quantity,
and <em>Musk</em> five times its weight; the following <em>Formulæ</em> illustrate this property,

<p class='c007'>Tragacanth is, strictly speaking, not soluble in water, but imbibes a
large portion of it and swells into a considerable bulk, forming a soft but
not a liquid mucilage; on the farther addition of water, a fluid solution
may be obtained by agitation, and the liquor is turbid; but on standing,
the mucilage subsides, the limpid water on the surface retaining a little of
the gum;<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c015'><sup>[566]</sup></a> it differs from all gums in giving a thick consistence to a larger
quantity of water, its power in this respect being to that of gum arabic as
twenty to one; one part converts twenty of hot water into a stiff mucilage.
Tragacanth is not increased, but actually diminished in solubility
by the addition of any other gum, it accordingly separates from water with
much greater facility when gum arabic is present. This preparation, according
to the Edinburgh college, consists of one part of gum and eight
of water; the resulting mucilage is stiff, and is principally employed for
making <em>troches</em>. The Dublin preparation contains four times that quantity
of water.</p>

<p class='c007'>This seed has not at present a place in the British pharmacopœiæ; it
presents however several points of interest to the physiologist, the physician,

known; and it has been administered in combination with gentian in intermittents.<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c015'><sup>[567]</sup></a>
(<em>Ludovic. Phar.</em> p. 113,) and as a narcotic in mania; it also

German writers have strongly commended it in mania, epilepsy, and hydrophobia;
as well as in chronic rheumatism, gout, scrophula, lues venera,
and cutaneous eruptions; in Sweden it is stated to have displayed very
beneficial effects in Dysentery. Dr. Fourquier has lately introduced its
use in the Hopital de la Charité, in cases of partial paralysis, and it is said,
with very great success.<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c015'><sup>[568]</sup></a> The value of the practice has been since confirmed
by the experiments of Dumeril, Majendie, Hebreard, Husson, and
Asselin. The dose is four or five grains of the powder in pills, during
the day. The French codex contains two alcoholic extracts of this substance;
the one prepared with a strong spirit (22, 32, Beaumé, i. e. from

have substituted the name <em>Strychnia</em>, because “a name dearly loved, ought
not to be applied to a noxious principle!”<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c015'><sup>[569]</sup></a> (<em>Annales de Chimie</em>, <em>vol.</em> 8 to
10.) Strychnia is highly alkaline, and crystallizes in very small four-sided
prisms, terminated by four-sided pyramids; its taste is insupportably
bitter, leaving a slight metallic flavour, and is so powerful as even to be
perceptible when a grain is dissolved in eighty pounds of water;<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c015'><sup>[570]</sup></a> it has
no smell; is not changed by exposure to the air, nor is it either fusible or
volatile, for when submitted to the action of heat, it only fuses at the moment
of its decomposition which takes place at a temperature inferior to
that which destroys most vegetable substances; it is so extremely active
and violent, that in doses of half a grain it occasions serious effects, and in
larger ones convulsions and death; it is perhaps the most powerful,<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c015'><sup>[571]</sup></a> and
next to hydro-cyanic acid, the most rapid of poisons; notwithstanding its
strong taste, it is very sparingly soluble in water, requiring 6667 parts of
that fluid for its solution at 50, and 2500 at 212°. It is very soluble in
alcohol, but unlike most of the other vegetable alkalies, is nearly insoluble
in æther; with acids it forms neutral and crystallizable salts; these
salts as well as their base, have the singular property of becoming bloodred
by the action of concentrated nitric acid. The alcoholic solution of
Strychnia has the property of precipitating the greater number of metallic
oxides from their acid solutions. It is precipitated by alkalies and alkaline
earths. Strychnia exists in native combination in the Strychnus with
an acid which has some analogy with the malic, and which Pelletier and
Caventou propose to call the <em>Igasuric acid</em>, from the Malay name for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>bean of St. Ignatius,<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c015'><sup>[572]</sup></a> (Strychnus Ignatius,) in which its properties were
first examined. In conformity with such views, the active principle of the
tribe of Strychni is an <em>Igasurate of Strychnia</em>;—a fact which suggests
the existence of a most singular and striking analogy between the chemical
constitution of these narcotico-acrid bodies<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c015'><sup>[573]</sup></a> and that of opium. The
recent experiments of Pelletier have shewn, moreover, that besides Strychnia,
the Nux Vomica contains <em>Brucia</em>, an alkaline body which had been
previously discovered in spurious Angustura. Its properties are similar
to those of Strychnia, but it is less active. Being much more soluble in
alcohol than <em>Strychnia</em>, if care be taken to crystallize the latter several
times in alcohol, it will be separated, the <em>Brucia</em> remaining in the <em>mother
waters</em>. Strychnia has been given in doses of one-twelfth of a grain, but
it is a most dangerous remedy, and is liable to occasion tetanic convulsions.<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c015'><sup>[574]</sup></a>
It has been said, however, to prove serviceable in cases of Epilepsy
that had resisted every other method of cure. Dr. Fleming informs
us that the Hindoos of upper India are in the habit of adding Nux Vomica
in the process of distilling Arrack, for the purpose of rendering the
spirit more intoxicating. The London Porter brewers have been accused
of the same pernicious practice.</p>

stain of grease will remain; as castor oil is more soluble in spirit than the
others, it is the one generally selected for this fraudulent purpose, and the
addition of alcohol restores the sophisticated oil to its proper degree of consistency.
<em>Alcohol</em> is discovered by adding water, which, if it be present,
occasions a milkiness, and at the same time, an increase of temperature;
a decrease of bulk also takes place, which may easily be ascertained by
measuring the oil and water separately, and then transferring them, in a
state of mixture, into a tube of small diameter. <em>Cheaper oils</em>, as that of
turpentine, are recognised by their peculiar odour, which may be developed
by rubbing a drop upon the hand and holding it to the fire, or, by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>dense black smoke with which they burn. The oil of aniseed, as it crystallizes
at 50°, is frequently sophisticated with wax, spermaceti, or camphor;
the fraud is detected by warming the oil, when the crystals, if genuine,
will dissolve.<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c015'><sup>[575]</sup></a> In some cases the refractive power of the oil affords

it is drunk with tea, instead of cream. <span class='sc'>Medical Uses.</span> For forming

for the diffusion of four parts of oil, (see <em>Mucilago Acaciæ</em>) the oil

<span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> A peculiar oil, combined with hydro-cyanic
acid. M. Vogel of Munich has lately succeeded in separating these constituents,
by agitating the whole in a concentrated solution of potass, and
distilling to dryness; the oil volatilized together with water, while the residuum
in the retort was found to contain <em>Cyanide of Potassium</em>. The volatile
oil, thus purified, is without odour, and heavier than water. Its taste
is extremely acrid and burning; by contact with air it crystallizes rapidly;
it dissolves easily in alcohol and æther, but only in a very small proportion
in water. The flame of its combustion is very brilliant, and accompanied
with much smoke. In order to discover whether this oil, when
freed from its hydro-cyanic acid, is still poisonous, M. Vogel put a drop of
it on the tongue of a sparrow; when it died, after violent convulsions, in a
few seconds; he also poisoned a dog, two months old, with four drops of
it; whence he concludes that the volatile oil, divested of its hydro-cyanic
acid, is still a poison, although less energetic than the oil that has not undergone
such a change. <em>Med: Uses.</em> It has all the characteristic effects
of prussic acid, but is so powerful and dangerous as to preclude its
application. It is principally sold to perfumers and confectioners.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is generally obtained by distilling the expressed cake of bitter almonds;

bland; <em>Odour</em>, none; it ought to congeal at 38° <em>Fah</em>. With the exception
of the oil of Almonds, it is the lightest of the fat oils, its specific gravity
being only ·915. According to the recent observations of Dr. Clarke
of Cambridge, this oil crystallizes in rectangular four-sided prisms with
square bases. <span class='sc'>Uses.</span> Although much less laxative than Castor oil, it is
a useful aperient. It was long regarded, but erroneously, as possessing
antidotal powers against the bites of venemous snakes and insects; and it
has been confidently recommended, in the form of liniment, as a remedy
against the Plague. <span class='sc'>Officinal Preparations.</span> <em>Linimentum Ammoniæ
Fortius</em>. L. <span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> It is not unfrequently mixed with the oil
of poppy seeds, (see <em>Papaveris Capsulæ</em>), a fraud which may be easily discovered
by exposing a sample to the freezing temperature, when the olive oil
will congeal, while that of poppies will remain fluid; and since those oils
which freeze with most difficulty are most susceptible of rancidity, the admixture
of poppy oil must be regarded as injurious: it also deserves notice
that the peculiar habitudes of <em>Oil of Olives</em>, with the <em>Pernitrate of Mercury</em>,
offer a distinguishing character, by which the adulteration of the oil may
be satisfactorily detected; for if the <em>pernitrate</em>, made by dissolving 6 parts
of the metal in 7·5 of nitric acid, of sp. grav. 1·36, at a common temperature,
be mixed with olive oil, the mixture, if kept cold, will in the course of
a few hours become solid, whereas if it has any admixture of the oil of
grains, it will not undergo such a change. The contamination derived
from lead, which is frequently immersed in the oil for the purpose of removing
its rancidity, may be detected by shaking one part of the suspected sample
with three parts of water, impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen, in
a stopped phial.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two kinds are found in commerce, distinguished by the name of <em>Turkey</em>
and <em>East India</em> Opium.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> <em>Form</em>, Turkey opium occurs in flat pieces, of a solid compact
texture, and possessing considerable tenacity; <em>Sp. gr.</em> 1·336, so that,
when compared with the condensed juices of other plants, it is heavy, being
exceeded only in this respect by opoponax and gum-arabic. By long
exposure to the air it becomes hard, breaks with a glimmering fracture,
owing to the presence of a few saline particles, and affords a yellowish
powder. It is opaque, tenacious, plastic, adherent to the fingers. <em>Colour</em>,
a reddish-brown, or fawn. <em>Odour</em>, peculiar, heavy, and narcotic. <em>Taste</em>,
at first a nauseous bitter, which soon becomes acrid with some degree of
warmth. It is inflammable, but yields no narcotic odour on burning.
<span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> It is partially soluble in water, alcohol, æther, wine, vinegar,
and lemon juice; when triturated with hot water, five parts in twelve
are dissolved, six suspended, and one part remains perfectly insoluble and
resembles <em>gluten</em>. By long boiling, its soporific powers are impaired and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>ultimately destroyed: the alcoholic is more highly charged with its narcotic
principle than the aqueous solution; but spirit, rather below proof,
is its best menstruum. The watery solution when filtered is transparent,
and reddens the colour of litmus; it undergoes no change on the addition
of alcohol, but precipitates occur from <em>pure ammonia</em> and from the <em>carbonates
of fixed alkalies</em>; from the solutions of <em>oxy-muriate of mercury</em>, <em>nitrate of silver</em>,
<em>sub-acetate and acetate of lead</em>, the <em>sulphates of copper, zinc, and iron</em>, and
from an <em>infusion of galls</em>. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> Resin, gum, bitter
extractive, sulphate of lime, gluten, <em>Narcotine</em> (<em>see note</em>) and a peculiar alkaline
body, to which the soporific virtues of opium are owing, and to
which the appropriate name of <em>Morphia</em> has been assigned; and it appears
moreover that this new alkaline body exists in combination with an unknown
acid, which has therefore been denominated the <em>Meconic Acid</em>; so
that the narcotic principle of opium is <em>Morphia</em> in the state of a <em>meconiate</em>,
or perhaps of a <em>super-meconiate</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>For these important facts we are indebted to the successive labours of
Derosne,<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c015'><sup>[584]</sup></a> Seguin,<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c015'><sup>[585]</sup></a> Sertuerner,<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c015'><sup>[586]</sup></a> and Robiquet. And the French codex
contains, in its appendix, formulæ for the preparation of morphia<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c015'><sup>[587]</sup></a> according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>to the directions of these two latter chemists: viz. <em>Robiquet’s</em> process.
Three hundred parts of pure opium are to be macerated during five days,
in one thousand parts of common water; to the filtered solution, fifteen
parts of perfectly pure magnesia (carefully avoiding the <em>carbonate</em>,) are to
be added; boil this mixture for ten minutes, and separate the sediment by
a filter, washing it with cold water until the water passes off clear; after
which, treat it alternately with hot and cold alcohol, (12, 22, Bé.) as long
as the menstruum takes up any colouring matter; the residue is then to
be treated with boiling alcohol (22, 32, Bé.) for a few minutes. The solution,
on cooling, will deposit crystals of <em>Morphia</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Rationale of the Process.</em> A soluble <em>Meconiate of Magnesia</em> is formed,
whilst the sediment consists of <em>Morphia</em> in the state of mixture, with the
excess of magnesia; the boiling alcohol with which this residuum is treated,
exerts no action upon the magnesia, but dissolves the <em>Morphia</em>, and
on cooling surrenders it in a crystalline form. A repetition of the treatment
with boiling alcohol will procure a fresh crop of crystals, and the
process should be continued until they cease to appear.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Sertuerner’s</em> method. It differs from the preceding, in substituting ammonia
for magnesia, and in adding to the sediment, separated as before
mentioned, as much sulphuric acid as is sufficient to convert the <em>Morphia</em>
into a sulphate, which is subsequently decomposed by a farther addition
of ammonia; the precipitate thus produced is then dissolved in boiling
alcohol, which on cooling surrenders the <em>Morphia</em> in a state of crystalline
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>purity. It appears however that the <em>Morphia</em> produced by this latter method,
is less abundant and more impure and coloured, than that which is
furnished by the process of Robiquet.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Characters of Morphia.</em> When pure, it crystallizes in very fine, transparent,
truncated pyramids, the bases of which are either squares or rectangles,
occasionally united base to base, and thereby forming octohedra.
It is sparingly soluble in boiling water, but dissolves abundantly in heated
alcohol; and the solution is intensely bitter; in æther it is far less soluble.
It has all the characters of an alkali; affecting test papers, tinged with
turmeric or violets; uniting with acids, and forming neutral salts, and decomposing
the compounds of acids with metallic oxides. It unites with
sulphur by means of heat, but the combination is decomposed at the same
instant; it is incapable of forming soap with an oxidized oil. It fuses at
a moderate temperature, when it resembles melted sulphur, and like that
substance, crystallizes on cooling; it is decomposed by distillation, yielding
carbonate of ammonia, oil, and a black resinous residue, with a peculiar
smell; when heated in contact with air, it inflames rapidly; the voltaic
pile exerts but little action upon it, yet, when mixed with a globule of mercury,
the latter appears to become increased in bulk, and to change consistence.
When analyzed by means of the deutoxide of copper, it yields
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; and if ammonia has been employed, as a
precipitant in its preparation, we shall also obtain some nitrogen, but not
if prepared according to the improved process of Robiquet. Its habitudes
with different bodies have not hitherto been sufficiently investigated, but
they are highly important, in as much as they will explain the operation
of those various medicinal compounds, into which opium enters as a principal
ingredient. <em>Sertuerner</em> has given us an account of the effect of the
alcoholic solution of Morphia on himself and three of his pupils; he found,
that repeated small doses of half a grain produced at first decided excitation;
then weakness, numbness, and tendency to fainting; after swallowing
vinegar while in this condition, violent vomiting was excited, profound
sleep intervened in one delicate individual, and next day he suffered from
nausea, vomiting, head-ache, anorexia, constipation, and heaviness (<em>Ann.
de Chim. et de Phys</em>. T. v.) This case is sufficient to shew that although
Morphia possesses the characteristic powers of opium, its strength is by
no means commensurate with its supposed concentration. When uncombined
it exerts little or no action in consequence of its insolubility. The
following history of its saline compounds may be useful.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Carbonate</em> crystallizes in short prisms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Acetate</em> in needles, very soluble, and extremely active.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Sulphate</em>, in arborescent crystals, very soluble.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Muriate</em>, in plumose crystals, much less soluble; when evaporated,
it concretes into a shining white plumose mass on cooling.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Nitrates</em>, in prisms grouped together.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Meconiate</em>, in oblique prisms, sparingly soluble.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Tartrate</em>, in prisms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morphia is separated from the above combinations by ammonia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morphia is very soluble in olive oil, and according to the experiments of
M. Majendie, the compound acts with great intensity; with extractive
matter, it forms a compound which is almost insoluble in water, but very
soluble in acids.</p>

<p class='c007'>The solubility of Morphia in acids explains why the administration of
vinegar increases the powers of opium, (<em>see</em> page 135.) <em>M. Majendie</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>considers Morphia to produce a more purely soporose effect than opium,
and that it is moreover exempt from the consecutive operation which so
generally renders opium objectionable. This opinion, however, has not
been confirmed by the trials made in this country; equally gratuitous is
the assertion of the same physiologist, that by ringing changes on the
salts of Morphia, its hypnotic effects may be kept up without increasing
its dose.</p>

<p class='c007'>As <em>M. Majendie</em> considers the <em>after</em> effects of opium to be independent
of Morphia, it was necessary for him to point out the particular principle
from which these noxious consequences arose, and he accordingly ascribed
them to the <em>Salt of Derosne</em>, now more usually denominated <em>Narcotine</em>,
and which may be entirely removed from the extract of opium by macerating
it in sulphuric æther; and in this way, it is said, a preparation is
obtained, which, like Morphia, is exempt from the occasional bad consequences
of the common drug; but no satisfactory trials have as yet been
made with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Meconic acid</em>, when separated from the residuum of the magnesian
salt, as described above, does not appear to possess any medicinal activity.
Its distinguishing <em>chemical</em> character is, that it produces an intensely red
colour in solutions of iron oxidized <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad maximum</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>East India Opium</span> is an inferior species;<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c015'><sup>[588]</sup></a> it differs from <em>Turkey Opium</em>,
in its <em>texture</em> being less compact, and much softer; its <em>colour</em> darker;
its narcotic <em>odour</em> fainter, but combined with a strong empyreuma, and in
its <em>taste</em> being more bitter, but less acrimonious. According to the experiments
of Mr. A. T. Thomson, <em>Turkey Opium</em> contains three times more
morphia than the <em>East Indian</em> variety. This latter, when triturated with
water, is taken up without any residuum; hence it contains no gluten,
but the sulphate of lime is more abundant, as appears from the relative
proportion of precipitate produced by oxalic acid. The solution of the
acetate of barytes, whilst it occasions no disturbance in the solutions of
the Turkey variety, produces a copious precipitate with the East Indian.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Med. Uses.</span> Are so well known that a few practical remarks will suffice.<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c015'><sup>[589]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Chemistry, it appears, has developed the principle of its activity, and
accumulated experience has established the value and importance of its
medicinal applications, but Physiology is still unable to demonstrate the
manner in which it produces its effects. It must be admitted that its primary
operation is that of a powerful and diffusible stimulant, but it is immediately
followed by narcotic and sedative effects, which are far greater
than could have been inferred from the degree of previous excitement, and
hence much keen controversy has arisen in the schools concerning its <em>modus
operandi</em>, (<em>see</em> page 76.) In large doses, the primary excitement is
scarcely apparent, but the powers of life are instantly depressed, drowsiness
and stupor succeed, and when the dose is excessive, these are followed
by delirium, stertorous breathing, cold sweats, convulsions, and apoplectic
death. Its stimulant effects are apparent only in small doses, by which
the energy of the mind,<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c015'><sup>[590]</sup></a> the strength of the pulse, and the heat of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>body, are considerably increased, but all the secretions and excretions, except
the cuticular<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c015'><sup>[591]</sup></a> discharge, are diminished; for example, the fæces of
persons, after the use of opium, are not unfrequently clay-coloured, from
the suspension of the biliary secretion; this circumstance suggests some
important precautions with respect to its exhibition. Opium, when properly
directed, is capable of fulfilling two great indications; 1st, of supporting
the powers of life, and 2nd, of allaying spasm, pain, and irritation,
and of blunting that morbid susceptibility of impression, which so frequently
attends fever. Its use is contra-indicated in all cases where inflammatory
action prevails, as in pulmonary affections, attended with an
accelerated circulation and a dry hard cough.<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c015'><sup>[592]</sup></a> It is employed by some
of the oriental nations for the same purposes that we take spirituous potations:
by the Turks especially, to whom our more generous beverages are
prohibited by religious prejudice, opium is solicited to inspire courage, or to
invigorate fortitude;—to soothe sorrow;—or to dissipate the remembrance
of misfortune;—to awaken the fancy to more brilliant exertions; or to
create that mild composure and serenity of feeling, which is desirable after
the cares and solicitudes of an active, perplexing, and arduous scene: like
spirituous liquors among other people, it is, in short, the support of the
coward,—the solace of the wretched,—and the daily source of intoxication
to the debauchee. Notwithstanding all this, spirit and opium are by
no means parallel medicines; on the contrary, the latter substance offers
the best remedy for the <em>Mania a Potu</em>, and in cases of habitual drunkenness
from alcohol, where our wish is to abstract the spirit, but are for obvious
reasons unable so to do, we may frequently alternate its use with that
of opium, with considerable advantage. Many of the beneficial effects of
this remedy are to be referred to its power of allaying irritability; Sir G.
Blane has remarked, that in ill-conditioned ulcers in the West Indies, opium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>was found superior to all other internal medicines for producing a disposition
to heal. Under the free use of it, such ulcers would in place of a
sanious discharge produce a healthy puss succeeded by granulations and
cicatrization. It appears to do this by suspending irritation, and perhaps
by promoting absorption.</p>

<p class='c007'>In combination, the medical powers of opium are wonderfully extended,
so that there is scarcely a disease in which it may not, during some of its
stages, be rendered useful. By diminishing the sensibility of the stomach
and bowels, it becomes a valuable and efficacious <em>corrigent</em> to many important
medicines, and thus frequently favours their absorption and introduction
into the system, as for instance, in the exhibition of mercurial alteratives,
(<em>Form. 141,</em>) and in certain diuretic combinations, (<em>Form. 100,
106, 107, 110,</em>) in combination with antimonials, and with ipecacuan, its
narcotic powers are obviated, and sudorific results are obtained. See <em>Pulv.
Ipecac. co</em>. (<em>Form. 117, 119, 124, 125, 127, 130.</em>) <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span>
In substance, or under the form of tincture. When we wish to continue
the operation of opium, and not to obtain its full effect at once, it may be
advantageously combined with some substance capable of retarding its
solution in the stomach, as <em>gum resins</em>. See <em>Pilulæ</em> and <em>Form. 10, 11, 12,
13</em>. A watery infusion, made by infusing powdered opium in boiling water,
will often operate without producing that distressing nausea and head-ache
which so frequently follow the use of this substance. With respect,
however, to the best modes of correcting the operation of this remedy, see
pages 160 and 162. Dr. Porter of Bristol has introduced to our notice
a solution of opium in citric acid; his formula<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c015'><sup>[593]</sup></a> for its preparation is subjoined,
because I am of opinion that it merits the attention of the practitioner;
I have lately submitted it to the test of experience, and it certainly
possesses the merit of a powerful anodyne, operating with less disturbance
than the more ordinary forms of this substance. I also take this opportunity
of stating, that the <em>pyroligneous acid</em> manufactured by Beaufoy was
used as a menstruum, and the effect of the solution was similar to that of
Dr. Porter. When the stomach rejects altogether the internal exhibition
of opium it may be successfully applied along the spine, by friction, with
the camphor liniment; a piece of solid opium introduced into the rectum,
or dissolved in some appropriate solvent, and injected as an enema, affords
also considerable relief in spasmodic affections of the bowels, and in painful
diseases of the prostate gland, or bladder, (<em>Form. 9.</em>) When thus
introduced into the rectum, it cannot undergo that change which the digestive
organs produce upon it, and consequently it is more uniform in its
action than when presented to the stomach. Opium appears to be readily
absorbed into the system, when applied to the surfaces of sores; considerable
relief has been thus afforded to irritable stumps, after amputation,
on which occasions, all the characteristic effects of opium have been produced
upon the system, such as costiveness, head-ache, nausea, &amp;c. <span class='sc'>Incompatible
Substances.</span> <em>Oxy-muriate of mercury</em>; <em>acetate of lead</em>; <em>alkalies</em>;
<em>infusions of galls</em>, and <em>of yellow cinchona</em>. Orfila states that the
decoction of <em>Coffee</em> is less energetic as an antidote, than the infusion.
When we intend the opium to act as a sedative, we should not combine it
with stimulants. The Edinburgh College certainly erred in this respect,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>when they made pepper an ingredient in their <em>Pilulæ Opiatæ</em>. In combination
with vegetable acids, its narcotic powers are increased, in consequence
of the formation of soluble salts with <em>morphia</em>.<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c015'><sup>[594]</sup></a> When the opium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>however has passed out of the primæ viæ, vinegar and acids are then the
best remedies for counteracting its effects; (see <em>page 136</em>.) <em>Dose</em>,
must be varied according to the intention of the prescriber, the constitution
of the patient, and the nature of the disease. A quarter of a grain, frequently
repeated, will keep up its exhilarating influence; (<em>Form. 15</em>) from
gr. j to ij acts as a narcotic; its power on the system soon becomes weaker;
and from habitual use it is so much impaired that very large doses are
required to produce its usual effects. Russell observes that the effects of
opium on those addicted to its use, are at first obstinate costiveness, succeeded
by diarrhœa and flatulence, with loss of appetite and a sottish appearance;
the teeth decay, the memory fails, and the unhappy sufferer
prematurely sinks into the grave. <span class='sc'>Officinal Prep.</span> Gr. j of opium is

The <em>Turkey Opium</em>, when good, is covered with leaves, and the reddish
capsules of some species of <em>rumex</em>; the inferior kinds have none of these
capsules adhering to them. It is frequently adulterated with the extract
of liquorice; it should be regarded as bad when it is very soft and friable,
of an intensely black colour, or mixed with many impurities, when it has
a sweetish taste, or marks paper with a brown continuous streak when
drawn across it, or when it melts like wax, and makes a yellow solution
in water. It frequently happens that in cutting a mass of opium, bullets
and stones have been found imbedded in it, a fraud which is committed by
the Turks, from which the retailer alone suffers. It is also adulterated
with the extract of poppy capsules, or of the whole plant; with that of
<em>chelidonium majus</em>, with gum arabic or tragacanth, with the oil of linseed,
and even with the dung of oxen.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pilulæ Hydrargyri.</span> L.E.D. <em>Pil. Mercuriales</em>. P.L. 1745, vulgo,
The <em>Blue Pill</em>. The mercury in this preparation, is not, as it was formerly
considered, in a state of mere mechanical division, but in that of a black
oxide, upon which its activity as a remedy undoubtedly depends; for
mercury in its metallic state is entirely inert with regard to the living system.
Various substances have at different times been triturated with the
mercury, for the purpose of <em>extinguishing</em> or <em>killing</em> it, by effecting the mechanical
division and subsequent oxidation of its particles, as manna, melasses,
&amp;c. <em>Conserve of Roses</em> is now generally preferred for this purpose,
although Swediaur suspects that the astringent principle of this conserve
invalidates the effects of the mercury, “I have,” says he, “given these
pills to several patients for a long time, without any symptom of salivation.”
Mr. Abernethy observes in his surgical works, that the <em>Pilulæ
Hydrargyri</em> are uncertain in their effects; and that some of the students
at the hospital on examining them, and different parcels of the conserve
of roses, say that the sulphuric acid may be discovered in each. Nor is it
improbable that in making the conserve for sale, some of this acid may be
added to brighten the colour; and if so, the mercurial pill which is made
from it may contain in varying proportions, some of that highly deleterious
compound, the <em>sub-sulphate of mercury</em>. When any of the gums are employed
for <em>killing</em> the metal, the pills soon become hard and brittle, and after
some time the mercury is liable to run into its metallic state. The pill-mass,
when rendered thinner by the addition of a little water, and extended
on a piece of paper, ought not to exhibit any metallic globules; in this
examination, however, we must be careful not to be betrayed by the fallacious
appearance which is frequently presented by small crystals of saccharine
matter. The relative proportion of mercury contained in the mass
can be ascertained only by its weight. The <em>blue pill</em> is made at Apothecaries’
Hall by a very ingenious machine actuated by steam, and which
rubs as well as rolls the materials, and it is said the pill thus made is more
active than that produced in the ordinary way. <span class='sc'>Med. Uses.</span> It is by far
the best form for the internal exhibition of mercury; where it is intended
to act upon the system as an alterative, it should be administered in doses
of from grs. iv to vj; if it occasion any action on the bowels, it may be conjoined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>with opium; sometimes a few grains of rhubarb, exhibited every
morning, will impart such a tone to the intestines, as to enable them to resist
the mercurial irritation. In cases where the form of pill is objectionable,
it may be readily suspended by the aid of mucilage, in some aqueous
vehicle; when exhibited in doses of grs. x to ℈j, it acts as a mild but efficient
purgative. <em>Form: 79, 106.</em> One grain of mercury is contained in
three grains of the mass; the proportion of metal, or oxide, in any other given
quantity, is shewn at once by the Dynameter. For the specific effects

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> An oily matter, fecula, and extractive; the
acrid principle of Pepper has been separated by Oersted in an alkaline
form. The following was the process by which it was procured. The
pepper having been digested in alcohol, muriatic acid and afterwards water
were added to the tincture, by which the resin was precipitated, while
a <em>muriate of Pipera</em> remained in solution. The solution was then, after
having been submitted to a certain evaporation, decomposed by pure
potass, when a precipitation of <em>Pipera</em> took place. This salifiable base is
nearly insoluble in cold, and only very slightly soluble in boiling water.
It dissolves in alcohol, and the solution has a greenish-yellow colour, which
by the addition of nitric acid is rendered green. The capacity of the base
for saturation appears very small. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> The virtues of pepper
are entirely extracted by æther and alcohol; and partially by water, 550
pints being required to extract all the sapidity of ℔j of pepper. <span class='sc'>Med.
Uses.</span> It appears to be a more general and permanent stimulus than
other species of equal pungency on the palate; it may be combined with
bitters, and exhibited in nausea, dyspepsia, retrocedent gout, or as a stimulant
in paralysis; it is also a valuable coadjutor to bark, in obstinate intermittents.
An infusion made with black pepper that has been toasted,
is often prescribed by the natives of India in cases of cholera morbus; and I

of peas-meal, both white and black, are mixed with real pepper-corns,
and sold as genuine pepper; the method of detecting the fraud is very
simple; throw a suspected sample into water; those that are artificial
will fall to powder, or be partially dissolved, while the true pepper-corns
will remain whole.</p>

“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pix nihil aliud quam combustæ resinæ fluxus.</span></i>” <em>Lib. 23. c. 1.</em> <span class='sc'>Chemical

Tar, and forms a solution of the colour of Madeira wine, with a sharp
empyreumatic taste. <span class='sc'>Med. Uses</span>. Tar water, under the auspices of
Bishop Berkley, was formerly considered a remedy of extraordinary powers;<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c015'><sup>[600]</sup></a>
this opinion however has at length passed away, (<em>see page 27</em>.)
and Tar is now particularly indebted for a place in the Materia Medica, to
an essay by Sir Alexander Crichton, entitled, “<em>An Account of some Experiments
made with the Vapour of boiling Tar,<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c015'><sup>[601]</sup></a> in the cure of Pulmonary Consumption</em>.”
At the request of Sir Alexander, I was induced to make a trial
of its effects, and I do not feel any hesitation in stating that the result has
led me to believe that it may, in some cases, be attended with benefit. In
the application of the remedy several precautions are necessary for its success.
The Tar employed should be that used in the cordage of ships;
to every pound of which half an ounce of sub-carbonate of potass must be
added, in order to neutralize the pyroligneous acid generally found mixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>with the tar, the presence of which will necessarily excite coughing; the
tar thus prepared is to be placed in a suitable vessel over a lamp, and to be
kept <em>slowly</em> boiling in the chamber during the night as well as the day;
the vessel however ought to be cleaned and replenished every twenty-four
hours, otherwise the residuum may be burnt and decomposed, a circumstance
which will occasion increased cough and oppression on the chest.
The ancients entertained a high opinion of the efficacy of Tar in pulmonary
diseases, when internally administered; supposing it to promote expectoration,
relieve dyspnæa, and check spitting of blood; Dioscorides particularly
speaks of its utility in such cases; he also recommends it to be applied
to ulcers, which he says it fills up and heals, whether they be situated
on the surface of the body, or in the ears, throat, and other internal
parts. See the chapter on “<em>Inhalations</em>,” <em>page 202</em>. <span class='sc'>Officinal Prep.</span>

an aggregation of acicular four-sided prisms terminated by dihedral summits,
which are slightly efflorescent; by careful crystallization, it may be

Composition.</span> Although it has been termed a <em>Super</em>-acetate, it
appears to be a neutral salt, and that its power of reddening valuable
blues is attributable to a partial decomposition; for when dissolved in water
containing the least portion of carbonic acid, a white carbonate of
lead is precipitated, and a corresponding portion of acetic acid is necessarily
disengaged. The College have therefore now designated it as an
<em>acetate</em>. According to the experiments of Berzelius, this salt, in its anhydrous
state, consists of one proportional of acetic acid, and one proportional
of oxide of lead; so that the proportion of the metallic base is one-third of
that in the <em>sub</em>-acetate. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> It is dissolved in 25 parts of water,
hot or cold; it is also soluble in alcohol. When common water is
employed the solution is quite turbid, unless a small proportion of acetic
acid be previously added. <span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span> <em>The alkalies,
alkaline earths and their carbonates</em>; <em>most of the acids</em>; <em>alum</em>; <em>borax</em>; the
<em>sulphates, and muriates</em>; <em>soaps</em>; <em>all sulphurets</em>; <em>ammoniated, and tartarized
iron</em>; <em>tartarized antimony</em>; <em>undistilled water</em>. The solution of <em>acetate of
ammonia</em> decomposes that of this salt, in consequence of the carbonic acid
which is generally diffused through it. It has lately been discovered that
<em>Gallic acid</em> and <em>Tannin</em> are capable of combining with lead in solution, and
of forming a perfectly insoluble substance, which falls to the bottom of the
vessel; hence all vegetable astringents must be considered as incompatible
with this medicine. On this account, liquors which have been kept in
oak casks,<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c015'><sup>[603]</sup></a> for a certain time, must be freed from lead. This explains a
fact, with respect to the effect of new rum in the West Indies, of some
importance. This spirit, when newly distilled, is found to contain traces
of lead, derived from the leaden rims of the coppers, and the leaden worm,
used for its condensation; but, by being kept about twelve months in
oaken casks, it loses its deleterious properties, and no longer exhibits any
traces of this metal.<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c015'><sup>[604]</sup></a> Certain bodies appear likewise to be incompatible
with the compounds of lead, not from the <em>chemical</em> changes they induce,
but from the contrary effects they produce upon the body; thus mercury
appears to invalidate their powers and to counteract their effects, as we
may have observed in treating saturnine cholic. I suspect also that antimony
operates in the same manner; M. Merat relates the case of an apothecary
who was cured of a desperate saturnine cholic, after having taken,
in the course of eight days, eighty grains of tartarized antimony. <span class='sc'>Med.
Uses.</span> I feel no hesitation in pronouncing this salt of lead to be one of
the most valuable resources of physic; from the results of numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>cases, I state with confidence that it is more efficient in stopping pulmonary
and uterine hemorrhage, than any other known remedy—“<em>nil simile,
nec secundum</em>,”—and that its application is equally safe and manageable;
but it must not be combined with substances capable of decomposing it,
nor must it be simultaneously administered with the medicines which are
frequently prescribed in conjunction with it, as an <em>Infusion of Roses</em>, <em>Sulphate
of Magnesia</em>, &amp;c. Alum has also been in some cases added to it,
with the intention of increasing its astringency. It is evident that under
such circumstances an insoluble and inert <em>Sulphate of Lead</em> will be produced.
The experiments of Orfila confirm the truth of these views, and
shew that such substances act as counter-poisons for the salts of lead.
According to my experience, those vegetable acids which decompose the
acetate of lead, and form insoluble salts with its base, are not <em>medically</em> incompatible,
when administered simultaneously with it, although no scientific
physician would prescribe such a mixture; this fact is shewn by the
circumstance of potations, containing malic and tartaric<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c015'><sup>[605]</sup></a> acids, not having
been found to invalidate the efficacy of this salt. Whether the stomach
in the first instance prevents the decomposition, and its necessary
results, or allows the operation of the usual affinities, and then subsequently
decomposes the insoluble compound which results from them, by
the abstraction and <em>digestion</em> of its vegetable constituent, are questions for
future inquiry, when the laws of gastric chemistry shall be better understood,
and more justly appreciated. I have also seen much benefit accrue
from this medicine in protracted diarrhœa, when it has checked the bowels
more effectually even than opium. M. Gaspard has communicated to
the public, through the medium of <cite><span lang="lfr" xml:lang="lfr">Majendie’s Journal de Physiologie</span></cite>, (3
numéro Juillet, 1821,) a paper upon the operation of <em>Acetate of Lead</em>, entitled
“<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Experiences Physiologiques et Medicales sur L’Acetate de Plomb</span></cite>,” in
which he asserts that this metallic salt cannot be administered without
risk in any dose, unless indeed it be given in vehicles which decompose it,
and which, he adds, appears generally to have happened in the prescriptions
of those who have given it extensively. He observes, that “it produces
a slow and peculiar inflammation of the bowels, as well as of the
lungs; and that it, moreover, occasions <em>Cholica Pictonum</em>.” No one, I apprehend,
will deny the poisonous quality of acetate of lead, any more
than that of arsenic; and yet both may, by proper management, be rendered
therapeutical agents of value and safety. <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span>

It is a most powerful caustic (<em>causticum commune acerrimum</em>), and is frequently
employed to establish an ulcer; or, instead of incision, to open a
tumour. It has the advantage of other caustics, from the circumstance of
our being able to neutralize its powers by touching it with vinegar, and
thus to arrest its progress in an instant; it is however more liable to produce
a large eschar than nitrate of silver, in consequence of the chemical
action of the alkali upon the skin. Within the last few years, surgeons
have greatly preferred the use of this caustic to that of <em>nitrate of silver</em>, in
cases of organic stricture of the urethra, as acting more powerfully, and
yet occasioning less irritation than the latter substance; it is also said that
the part which it destroys is sooner detached and more easily eliminated.
Its disposition, however, to extend its sphere of action has occasioned such
a destruction of the membrane as to allow the urine to pass into the cellular

and another part forms, with the excess of Sulphur, Bi-Sulphuretted hydrogen;
this latter body uniting with the base, produces what has been
termed an <em>Hydroguretted Sulphuret</em>, but which might be more properly
called an <em>Hydro-bi-Sulphuret</em>; upon adding an acid to the solution, a quantity

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> <em>Form</em>, small irregular brittle crystals, which when reduced
to powder are termed <em>cream of tartar</em>. <em>Taste</em>, harsh and acid.
<span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> It is a <em>bi-tartrate</em>, consisting of two proportionals
of acid and one proportional of potass. <em>Solubility.</em> It requires
120 parts of water at 60°, and 30 parts at 212°, for its solution; it is
slightly soluble in alcohol. The watery solution of this salt was first observed
by Berthollet to undergo a spontaneous decomposition by keeping,
during which a mucous matter is deposited, and there remains a solution
of carbonate of potass coloured with a little oil. It has long been regarded
a pharmaceutical desideratum to increase the solubility of <em>cream of tartar</em>;
Vogel discovered that it might be accomplished by combining it with
boracic acid, and accordingly a formula has been introduced into the Codex
Medicamentarius of Paris, for preparing a “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tartras Acidulus Potassæ
Solubilis, admixto Acido Boracico</span></i>.” The following is the process. Let
thirty parts of boracic acid, and twenty parts of distilled water be heated
together in a silver dish; as soon as this has been effected, add, in divided
portions, 120 parts of super-tartrate of potass, taking care to shake the
mixture continually; the whole will soon liquefy, (“<em>mire liquescent</em>,”) and
by continuing the heat, a pulverulent mass will result. As it is extremely
deliquescent it must be carefully preserved from the contact of the
air; it dissolves in its own weight of water at 55°, and in half its weight
at 212°. It is probable that the result is a new salt, in which the boracic
and tartaric acids exist in combination,<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c015'><sup>[614]</sup></a> but grant even that the chemical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>identity of the super-tartrate is preserved inviolate in the compound, I
would ask what medical advantage can possibly attend the discovery?
The peculiar value of cream of tartar depends doubtless upon its comparative
insolubility, as I have already stated at page 173; modify
this, and you will instantly change the medicinal effects of the salt;
for like the neutral tartrate it will act upon the bowels, and therefore
cease to undergo those changes <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in transitu</span></i> which are essential to its characteristic
operation. Alum also has been observed by Berthollet to have
in some measure the same effect in increasing the solubility of cream of
tartar. <span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span> <em>Alkalies</em> and <em>alkaline earths</em>; the
<em>mineral acids</em>, &amp;c. <span class='sc'>Med. Uses.</span> In doses of ʒiv to ʒvj, it acts as a hydragogue
cathartic, producing a considerable discharge of serous fluid into
the intestines; when however it is often repeated, it is liable to occasion
debility of the digestive organs, and consequent emaciation: in smaller
doses it acts as a diuretic. (<em>Form. 112.</em>) ʒj in oj of boiling water, flavoured
with lemon peel and sugar, forms when cool an agreeable beverage
well known by the name of <em>Imperial</em>. A <em>Cream of Tartar Whey</em> may
be made, by adding to a pint of milk (when it begins to boil) ʒij of <em>Cream
of Tartar</em>; the pan must then be removed from the fire, the whole suffered
to cool, and the <em>whey</em> separated from the curd by straining; this whey,
diluted with warm water, furnishes an excellent drink in Dropsy. As it
decomposes the carbonate of potass, the union of these salts will afford a
very pleasant purgative draught. (<em>Form. 82.</em>) <span class='sc'>Officinal Preparations.</span>

its acid is decomposed, and its alkali remains in a state of a <em>sub-carbonate</em>.

succedaneum of the celebrated <em>fever powder of Dr. James</em>, the composition
of which was ascertained by Dr. George Pearson. (<em>Phil. Trans.</em> lxxxi.
317.) It consists of 43 parts of the phosphate of lime, mixed, or perhaps
chemically combined, with 57 parts of oxide of antimony, of which a portion
is vitrified; and it is probable, that the difference of the two remedies
depends principally upon the quantity of oxide which is vitrified: the specification
of the original medicine is worded with all the ambiguity of an
ancient oracle, and cannot be prepared by the process as it is described.<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c015'><sup>[617]</sup></a>
Experience has established the fact, that <em>James’s Powder</em> is less active than
its imitation; it affects the bowels and stomach very slightly, and passes
off more readily by perspiration; in general however the difference is so
inconsiderable, that we need not regret the want of the original receipt.<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c015'><sup>[618]</sup></a>

(<b>H</b>) <em>one part</em>, sulphate of potass (<b>M</b>) <em>eight parts</em>. This combination
has been long established in practice, as a valuable sudorific, under the
name of <em>Dover’s Powder</em>. It affords one of the best examples of the power
which one medicine possesses of so changing the action of another, as
to produce a remedy of new properties; in this combination the opium is
so modified, that it may be given with perfect safety and advantage in inflammatory
affections accompanied with increased vascular action: it
would seem that whilst the opium increases the force of the circulation, the
ipecacuan relaxes the exhalant vessels, and causes a copious diaphoresis:
the sulphate of potass is also an important ingredient, for experience has
fully proved that ipecacuan and opium, in the same proportions, have not
so powerful an effect without it; its action must be purely mechanical,
dividing and mixing the active particles more intimately, and it appears
that the success of the remedy depends very much upon its being finely
powdered. <em>Dose</em>, grs. v. to ℈j, diffused in gruel, or in the form of a bolus.
(See <em>Form. 120, 121, 122</em>.) The saline constituent in the original <em>Dover’s
Powder</em>, was the result of the deflagration of nitre, and was therefore deliquescent;
its dose was as much as from 40 to 70 grains. In the <em>Codex</em> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>Paris, this compound is directed to be prepared by melting together <em>four
parts</em> of sulphate of potass, with an equal proportion of nitrate of potass;
to which when nearly cold is to be added, and well mixed by triture, <em>one
part</em> of pulverized extract of opium; the powders of ipecacuan and liquorice
root, of each <em>one part</em>, are to be added last. It is evident that the proportions
of opium and ipecacuan in this combination, are less than those in
ours, and yet it is said to be more powerfully diaphoretic on account of the
nitre. An arrangement, which is indebted for its medicinal virtue to a
similar mode of operation, is presented in <em>Form. 130</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pulvis Tragacanthæ Compositus.</span> L. Powdered Tragacanth, acacia
gum, and starch, of each <em>one part</em>; refined sugar, <em>two parts</em>. From
what has been already stated under the head of mucilage of tragacanth,
it appears to be a superfluous, if not an injudicious demulcent; and since
starch is insoluble in cold water, the object for introducing it is not very
obvious. <em>Form. 120.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Powders should be preserved in opaque green bottles, as they are materially

only when they are required. The practitioner is also cautioned against
purchasing any medicine in its powdered form, for so universal is the system
of adulteration, that regular formulæ are observed in the wholesale

<p class='c007'>Although this plant has not yet found its way into the materia medica
of the Pharmacopœia, its credited virtues entitle it to some notice in the
present work. It was first brought into repute in this country by Dr.
Somerville (<em>Med: Chirug: Trans: Vol. 5</em>). It is bitter, and consists of
Resin, gum-resin, tannin, and bitter extractive. Alcohol and proof spirit
are its best menstrua, but the watery infusion appears to contain all the
virtues of the plant. <span class='sc'>Med. Uses.</span> It is said to be diuretic, tonic, and deobstruent;
there is, however, no evidence to shew that it acts, specifically,
on any other than the urinary organs. Dr. Ives, in the American edition
of the present work, says, that as a diuretic medicine it has unquestionable
merit, and that it will frequently mitigate symptoms of gravel, and
strangury proceeding from other causes; he does not, however, agree
with Dr. Barton, in considering it <em>Antilithic</em>. He has also given it, alternately
with the <em>Uva Ursi</em>, in hæmaturia; the effects of severe and long
continued gonorrhœal inflammation, with the most obvious benefit, and he
considers it very analogous in its operation to the <em>Uva Ursi</em>. In some instances
it has appeared to afford great relief in chronic cutaneous diseases.
Further observation is necessary to define the mode and extent of its medicinal
operation, but there is no hazard in saying that it is a medicine possessing
considerable activity. Dr. Barton observes that this plant, like
Uva Ursi, occasionally imparts a black tinge to the urine. <span class='sc'>Dose</span> ʒi to

<p class='c007'>This wood owes all its properties to a peculiar bitter principle, which
has been examined by Dr. Thomson and named <em>Quassin</em>; it is solid,
slightly transparent, and of a yellowish-brown colour. (<em>See Infusum

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> <em>Odour</em>, none; <em>taste</em>, rough and astringent. <span class='sc'>Chemical
Composition.</span> We are indebted to Sir H. Davy for a knowledge of this
subject; he found that an ounce of the inner cortical part of young oak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>bark afforded by lixivation 111 grains of solid matter, of which 77 were
<em>tannin</em>; and the cellular integument, or middle-coloured part, only yielded
43 grains of solid matter, of which 19 were <em>tannin</em>; and the epidermis
furnished scarcely any quantity of <em>tannin</em> or extractive; hence the bark
should be selected from the smaller branches of the oak where the epidermis
is still thin. Experience has, moreover, shewn that the quantity of
<em>tannin</em> varies considerably, not only according to the age and size of the
trees, but according to the season at which they are <em>barked</em>; thus, the
bark cut in spring contains, according to <em>Beguin</em>,<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c015'><sup>[620]</sup></a> four times more of the
astringent principle, than that which is obtained in winter. <span class='sc'>Med. Uses.</span>
All its properties depend upon the presence of <em>tannin</em>, it is therefore only
valuable as a powerful astringent; it is accordingly employed to check
inordinate discharges, see <em>Decoctum Quercus</em>. Oak bark is sometimes administered
in the form of powder, combined with ginger and other aromatics,
and bitters, for the cure of intermittents, and it has frequently succeeded,
but see page 167. Dose, ℈j to ʒss. In the form of poultice
this powder is said to have proved highly useful to gangrenous sores.
Its inhalation has also been supposed to prove beneficial in consumption;
a striking case is related by Dr. Eberle of a man who had laboured under
the usual symptoms of confirmed Phthisis, and who, at the time he went
to grind in a bark-mill, was extremely weak and emaciated; in a short
time, however, the cough, night sweats, and other hectic symptoms, began
to abate sensibly, and in less than three months he was perfectly restored
to health.</p>

in the middle; <em>Colour</em>, lively yellow with streaks of white; it is
easily pulverized, affording a powder of a bright buff-yellow colour.
<span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> Gum, resin, extractive, tannin, gallic acid,
and a peculiar colouring matter, with traces of alumina and silex; the
white or flesh-coloured streaks pervading its substance, consist of sulphate
and oxalate of lime: according to the experiments of Mr. John Henderson,
there is besides a peculiar vegetable acid, to which he has given the
name of <em>Rheumic</em> acid, but M. de Lassaignes has satisfactorily proved that
this is no other than the oxalic acid: the purgative powers of the root appear
to be intimately connected with its extractive and resinous elements,
but the subject is still involved in considerable obscurity. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span>
Water at 212° takes up 24 parts in 60, see <em>Infusum Rhei:</em> by decoction,
its purgative qualities are lost, and it becomes more bitter and astringent;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>alcohol extracts 2·7 from 10 parts, (see <em>Tinct. Rhei</em>.) <span class='sc'>Med. Uses.</span> In
this substance, Nature presents us with a singular and most important
combination of medicinal powers, that of an astringent, with a cathartic
property; the former of which never opposes or interferes with the energy
of the latter, since it only takes effect when the substance is administered
in small doses, or if given in larger ones, not until it has ceased to operate
as a cathartic; this latter circumstance renders it particularly eligible in
cases of diarrhœa, as it evacuates the offending matter before it operates
as an astringent upon the bowels. It seems to act more immediately upon
the stomach and small intestines, and therefore in relaxed and debilitated
states of these organs, it will prove an easy and valuable resource; it
may, for such an object, be exhibited in conjunction with alkalies, bitters,
and other tonics. Its cathartic property is most efficient when given in
substance. It was formerly supposed that by toasting rhubarb we increased
its astringency, but this process merely diminishes its purgative
force, so that a larger dose may be taken. The colouring matter of rhubarb
may be detected in the urine of persons to whom it has been exhibited;
it does not however appear to possess any specific powers as a diuretic.
<span class='sc'>Dose</span>, grs. vj to x as a tonic; ℈j to ʒss as a purgative; the operation
of which is considerably quickened by the addition of neutral salts;
the super-sulphate of potass forms also a very useful adjunct, and its acidulous
taste completely covers that of the rhubarb. <em>Form. 83, 85.</em> Its

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> <em>Form</em>, long pieces, sometimes flat, as if they had been compressed;
they are heavier, harder, and more compact than those of the
preceding species, and are seldom perforated with holes; <em>Odour</em>, stronger;
<em>Taste</em>, more nauseous; white streaks less numerous, and they afford a

It differs from the <em>Turkey</em> in containing less tannin and resin,
and according to the experiments of Mr. A. T. Thomson, less oxalate of
lime, in the ratio of 18 to 26. It contains however more extractive and
gallic acid. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> Water takes up one half of its weight, but the
infusion, although more turbid, is not so deep coloured as that of Russian
rhubarb; alcohol extracts 4 parts in 10. It habitudes with acids, alkalies,
and neutral salts, differ likewise from those of the Russian variety, as
Mr. A. T. Thomson has exhibited in a very satisfactory manner. (<cite>London
Dispensatory, Edit. 3, p. 474.</cite>) <span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> The inferior kinds
of <em>Russian</em>, <em>East Indian</em>, and even <em>English</em> rhubarb, are artfully dressed up
and sold under the name of Turkey rhubarb. I am well informed that a
number of persons in this town, known in the trade by the name of <em>Russifiers</em>,
gain a regular livelihood by the art of dressing this article, by boring,
rasping, and then colouring the inferior kinds; for which they charge
at the rate of eighteen-pence per pound. The general indications of good
rhubarb are, its whitish or clear yellow colour, and its possessing the other
characteristic properties as above mentioned; it ought also to possess in
an eminent degree the peculiar odour, for when this is dissipated, the powers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>of the medicine are nearly destroyed. In the form of powder, rhubarb
is always more or less mixed with foreign matter; the detection of which
can be alone effected by a trial of its efficacy.</p>

ethereal menstrua. <span class='sc'>Med. Uses.</span> It is mildly cathartic, and is particularly
eligible in cases where stimulating purgatives would prove hurtful, but
in obstinate constipation, where copious evacuations are required, this oil
cannot be trusted, it will insinuate itself through the intestinal canal, bringing
with it a small portion of the more fluid contents, but leaving behind
it the collection of indurated fæces. <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span> The most
efficacious mode of administering it is by floating it upon tincture of senna,
or peppermint water, or some other similar vehicle; it is also sometimes
given with success in coffee or mutton broth, or suspended in water by the
intervention of mucilage, yelk of egg (<em>Form. 75</em>,) or by honey, which at
the same time contributes to its laxative operation: alkalies, although they
form an emulsion with it, convert it into a saponaceous compound, and impair
its cathartic force. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, f℥ss to f℥iss. <span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> It is
usually adulterated with olive oil or poppy oil, and when to a considerable
extent, scammony is added to quicken its operation. There is however a
peculiarity in castor oil which serves to distinguish it from every other fixed
oil, viz. its great solubility in rectified spirit; for instance, f℥iv of alcohol
of ·820 will mix uniformly with any proportion of castor oil, whereas it
will not dissolve more than fʒj of <em>Linseed Oil</em>; and a still less proportion
of the expressed oils of almonds and of olives; when the spirit is diluted,
its action on all these oils is equally diminished, so that <em>common spirit of
wine</em> has but little power even over castor oil; but here chemistry again
interposes its aid, for by the addition of camphor, in the proportion of one
part to eight of spirit, spirit of ·840 is enabled to dissolve castor oil, whilst
it has no influence upon the other fixed oils; castor oil is also soluble in
any proportion, in sulphuric æther of the specific gravity ·7563, while four
fluid-ounces of the same liquid will only dissolve a fluid-ounce and a quarter
of the expressed oil of <em>Almonds</em>; a fluid-ounce and a half of that of
<em>Olives</em>; and two fluid-ounces and a half of <em>Linseed oil</em>. Vogel introduced
a composition as a substitute for this oil, which some practitioners have
greatly extolled; it consisted of nine grains of the extract of Jalap, and
three grains of Venetian soap, triturated in a mortar with an ounce and a
half of Olive oil.</p>

It possesses highly stimulating properties, and has been used as a diaphoretic,
anthelmintic, and emmenagogue. Rave, a German writer of great
respectability, speaks of its use in chronic rheumatism in the highest
terms; Alibert commends its anthelmintic powers, but its reputation has
principally rested upon its generally acknowledged influence over the uterus.
The testimony of Dr. Home of Edinburgh is strong in favour of its
emmenagogue powers, but the adverse opinion of Dr. Cullen brought it into
disrepute. It occasions a manifest flow of blood to the uterus, but this
is probably sympathetically produced by its direct action on the large intestines;
for if given in large doses it occasions great heat in the primæ
viæ, hæmorrhage, and inflammation of the bowels. It is therefore inadmissible
in all cases which are attended with fever, or much vascular action.
When amenorrhœa depends upon a relaxed state of the general
system, or on an inactive and torpid condition of the uterine system, it may
often be employed with advantage. Wedekind, a German writer, extols
it in the treatment of that atonic or relaxed state of the uterus, attended
with an unnatural secretion and soft swelling of the uterus, which is sometimes
met with in women who have suffered much from repeated childbearing,
and which is so generally attended with a train of hysteric
disturbances. Dr. Eberle says that he has occasionally employed it in
cases of Amenorrhœa, in females of a relaxed habit of body; and although
sometimes without success, he has had sufficient evidence of its powers
to establish its claim to attention. In several cases, similar to those
above stated, I have employed the Savin with much success, but I have
found it very liable to disturb the stomach, and to produce head-ache.
<span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span> Some practitioners have recommended that of
powder, but it is almost impossible to pulverize it without previously drying
it at a temperature which will dissipate the essential oil, upon which
its activity depends. The tincture affords a more convenient form, and a
compound tincture formerly occupied a place in the Pharmacopœia, but
has been abandoned. A decoction of an ounce of the leaves to a pint of
water, with the addition of syrup, has been also recommended; an infusion,
however, would be preferable. <span class='sc'>Dose</span>, of the powdered leaves from grs. v
to x; of the tincture fʒj; of the decoction f℥ss to f℥j. As an external local
stimulant, or escharotic, the dried leaves in powder are applied to warts,
flabby ulcers, and carious bones; and the expressed juice diluted, or an infusion
of the leaves, as a lotion to gangrenous sores, scabies, and <em>tinea capitis</em>;
or mixed with lard and wax as an issue ointment. The German
writers speak very highly of its effects as a poultice to old and obstinate
sores. <span class='sc'>Officinal Prep.</span> <em>Oleum Volatile Juniperi Sabinæ</em>. E.D. (the

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>The experiments of Orfila have shewn that Savine exerts a local action,
but that its effects depend principally on its absorption; through which
medium it acts on the nervous system, the rectum, and the stomach. It
still enjoys amongst the vulgar the reputation of being capable of producing
absorption.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Sugar, as a pharmaceutical agent, is employed for accelerating the pulverization
of various resinous substances, and when exhibited with the
most acrid of them, it prevents their adhesion to the coats of the intestines,
by which they might irritate and inflame them; it is also extensively used
on account of its power in preserving animal<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c015'><sup>[626]</sup></a> and vegetable substances.
(See <em>Conservæ</em>.) Milk boiled with fine sugar will keep for a great length
of time, and might be very conveniently employed during a long voyage.
Dr. Darwin also observes that fresh meat cut into thin slices, either raw or
boiled, might be preserved in coarse sugar or treacle, and would furnish a
very salutary and nourishing diet to our sailors. Sugar exerts also some
chemical affinities which are highly interesting to the pharmaceutic chemist.
Vogel has published a paper to shew, that when sugar is boiled with
various metallic oxides, and with different metalline salts, it has the property
of decomposing them; sometimes reducing the oxide to the state of
a metal, and at others depriving the oxide only of one of the proportionals
of oxygen; thus <em>sulphate of copper</em> and <em>nitrate of mercury</em> are precipitated in
a metallic form, whilst <em>peroxide of mercury</em> and <em>acetate of copper</em> are converted
into protoxides; <em>corrosive</em> sublimate is changed into <em>calomel</em>, but <em>calomel</em> is
not susceptible of any further decomposition. All those metallic salts which
have the power of decomposing water are not affected by sugar, as those
of <em>iron</em>, <em>zinc</em>, <em>tin</em>, and <em>manganese</em>. It appears, moreover, that sugar has the
property of rendering some of the Earths soluble in water. Sugar in water,
at the temperature of 50°, is capable of dissolving one half of its weight
of lime; the solution thus produced is of a beautiful white-wine colour,
and has the smell of fresh-slacked quick-lime. It is precipitated from the
solution by the <em>carbonic</em>, <em>citric</em>, <em>tartaric</em>, <em>sulphuric</em>, and <em>oxalic</em> acids; and it is
decomposed, by double affinity, by <em>caustic</em> and <em>carbonated potass</em> and <em>soda</em>,
and by the <em>citrate</em>, <em>tartrate</em>, and <em>oxalate of potass</em>, &amp;c. The union of sugar
with the alkalies has been long known, and in the decomposition of the
solution of lime in sugar by the salts above mentioned, the acid unites with
the lime, and the alkaline base forms a compound with the sugar.</p>

its effects by correcting any acidity which may prevail in the <em>primæ

lime, and a solution of soda; in habitual constipation, and in biliary obstructions,
it is frequently prescribed in conjunction with rhubarb, or some

in increasing the solubility of the substance with which it is united. It

the principal constituent; 16 parts of good <em>Aleppo</em> Scammony yield 11
parts of resin, and 3½ of watery extract. That from <em>Smyrna</em> contains not
more than half the quantity of resin, but more extractive, and gum. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span>
Water, by trituration, takes up one-fourth, alcohol two-thirds,
and proof spirit dissolves all, except the impurities. <span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span>
Neither acids, metallic salts, nor ammonia, produce any change
in its solutions, but the fixed alkalies occasion yellow precipitates; and yet
they do not appear to be <em>medicinally</em> incompatible with it; thus Gaubius,
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scammoneum acidi commixtio<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c015'><sup>[631]</sup></a> reddit inertius; alcali fixum, contra, adjuvat</span></i>.”
The mineral acids appear to destroy a part of the substance, without in the
least altering the rest. The discrepancy which exists in authors respecting
the power of this drug, seems to have arisen from its operation being
liable to uncertainty, in consequence of peculiar states of the alimentary
canal; for instance, where the intestines are lined with an excess of mucus,
it passes through without producing any action, but where the natural
mucus is deficient, a small dose of scammony may irritate and even inflame
the bowels. In this latter case, my practice has been to administer
the purgative in a mucilaginous draught, or emulsion. <span class='sc'>Med. Uses.</span>

<span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> Two kinds of Scammony are imported into this country,
that from <em>Aleppo</em>, which is the best; and that from <em>Smyrna</em>, which is
more compact and ponderous, but less pure: it is commonly mixed with
the expressed juice of the <em>cynanchum monspeliacum</em>; it is also sophisticated
with <em>flour</em>, <em>sand</em>, and <em>ashes</em>; their presence may be detected by dissolving
the sample in proof spirit, when the impurities will sink, and remain undissolved;
carbonate of lime is moreover frequently added to Scammony,
in which case the sample will effervesce in acids: there is however a compound
bearing the name of Scammony, to be met with in the market,
which is altogether factitious, consisting of jalap, senna, manna, gamboge,
and ivory black. Good Scammony ought to be friable, and when wetted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>with the finger, it should <em>lactify</em>, or become milky: and the powder should

(<em>Scillitin</em>, which is white, transparent, and breaks with a resinous fracture)
35—woody fibre 30. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> Squill gives out its virtues so perfectly
to any of the ordinary menstrua, as to render the form of its exhibition,
in that respect, a matter of indifference. <span class='sc'>Incompatible Substances.</span>
<em>Alkalies</em> diminish their acrimony and bitterness, and are probably <em>medicinally</em>
inconsistent with their diuretic qualities, but farther experiments are
required to decide this question: <em>vegetable acids</em> produce no effect upon
their sensible qualities, but are said to increase their expectorant power.
<span class='sc'>Med. Uses.</span> According to the dose, and circumstances under which it
is administered, it proves expectorant, diuretic, emetic, or purgative; as
an expectorant, it can never be employed where pulmonary inflammation
exists, for in such cases, instead of promoting, it will check any excretion
from the lungs; its combination with a diaphoretic will frequently
increase its powers, and generally be a measure of judicious caution.
See <em>Form, 133, 134, 135, 139</em>. For the philosophy of its action, the reader
must refer to the classification of Expectorants, page 102. As a diuretic,
it seems to act by absorption, and we accordingly find, on the authority of
Dr. Cullen, that <em>when the squill operates strongly on the stomach and intestines,
its diuretic effects are less likely to happen</em>; he therefore found that by accompanying
it with an opiate, (<em>Form. 100)</em> the emetic and purgative operation
may be avoided, and the squill be thereby carried more entirely to
the kidneys. Experience, moreover, has taught us the value of combining
this medicine with some mercurial preparation, by which its diuretic powers
are very considerably augmented; and it has been farther stated, that
such a combination is particularly efficacious in Hydrothorax, especially
when it produces inflammation of the gums, and of the glands about the
throat, by which action it is supposed to cause a derivation from the exhalants
of the pleura, and thereby to diminish the dropsical effusion. (<em>Form:
102, 103, 106, 107, 109, 112, 115</em>,) but we must take care that the remedy
does not occasion purging. In the exhibition of squill, it has been often
delivered as a rule, to give it to the extent necessary to induce nausea,
as affording a test of the medicine being in a state of activity; such a
state of the system, moreover, may assist the absorption of the remedy.
Dr. Home, in opposition to the opinion of Cullen, maintained that the powers
of Squill as a diuretic, were increased by combining it with bodies capable
of promoting its full emetic operation: after what has been observed,
however, it is unnecessary to dwell upon the mischievious tendency of
such a practice. By referring to our tabular arrangement of Diuretics,
page 102, the reader will find that I consider its action upon the urinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>organs to depend upon its bitter principle (<em>Scillitin</em>) being developed, and
carried, by the medium of the circulation, to the secreting vessels of the
kidneys, which it thus stimulates by actual contact. As an emetic, it has
been advised in solution, in cases of hooping cough, but its extreme uncertainty
renders it unfit for exhibition, unless as an adjunct to emetic combinations,
as in <em>Form: 65</em>. <em>Plenck</em> makes mention of a child which had
convulsions in consequence of taking some Squill. <span class='sc'>Dose.</span> Of the dried

    <div>SECALE CORNUTUM.</div>
    <div class='c004'>(Spurred Rye, or Ergot of Rye.)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>[Various opinions have been entertained in relation to the nature of
Ergot. The most probable is that it is a parasitic fungus, attached to several
species of the gramina, but more especially to the rye. It is generally
found most abundant in moist situations and in wet seasons. Its
taste, at first scarcely perceptible, becomes shortly disagreeable and sub-acrid.
By the analysis of Vauquelin, the ergot has been ascertained to
contain, 1. A fawn-yellow colouring matter, soluble in alcohol, and having
a taste resembling that of fish oil. 2. A white oily matter, of a sweetish
taste, which appears to be very abundant. 3. A violet colouring principle,
of the same shade as that of orchil, but differing from it by its solubility
in alcohol, and which can be readily fixed on aluminated wool and
silk. 4. A free acid, supposed to be partly phosphoric. 5. A very abundant
vegeto-animal substance, much disposed to putrefaction, and which
furnishes a considerable quantity of thick oil and of ammonia by distillation.
6. A small quantity of free ammonia, which can be obtained at the
temperature of boiling water. As a medicinal substance, ergot exerts a
specific effect upon the uterus, and is very generally used in this country
for the purpose of facilitating the process of parturition. From the powerful
effects produced by the ergot, it is obvious that it should be used with
much caution. Dr. Stearns, to whom the profession is indebted for the
first introduction of this article into practice, and who must be considered
as our highest authority on this subject, has laid down the following rules
by which its administration should be regulated: 1. It should never be
administered where nature is competent to a safe delivery. 2. It should
never be administered until the regular pains have ceased, or are ineffectual,
and there is danger to be apprehended from delay. 3. It should
never be administered until the rigidity of the os tincæ has subsided, and
a perfect relaxation has been induced. 4. It should never be administered
in the incipient stages of labour, nor until the os tincæ is dilated to the
size of a dollar. 5. It should never be administered in any case of preternatural
presentation that will require the fœtus to be turned. 6. It
should never be administered during the continuance of one labour, in
larger quantities than thirty grains by decoction in half a pint of water.
A table spoonful of this given every ten minutes, generally succeeds better
than a larger dose. While this quantity produces its most favourable effects
upon the uterus, it does not affect the stomach with nausea or vomiting,
which sometimes interrupts its successful operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ergot is indicated, and may be administered, 1. When, in lingering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>labours, the child has descended into the pelvis, the parts dilated and relaxed,
the pains having ceased, or being too ineffectual to advance the
labour, there is danger to be apprehended from delay, by exhaustion of
strength and vital energy, from hemorrhage or other alarming symptoms.
2. When the pains are transferred from the uterus to other parts of the
body, or to the whole muscular system, producing general puerperal convulsions.
After premising copious bleeding, the ergot concentrates all
these misplaced labour-pains upon the uterus, which it soon restores to its
appropriate action, and the convulsions immediately cease. 3. When in
the early stages of pregnancy, abortion becomes inevitable, accompanied
with profuse hemorrhage and feeble uterine contractions. 4. When the
placenta as retained from a deficiency of contractions. 5. In patients liable
to hemorrhage immediately after delivery. In such cases the ergot
may be given as a preventive, a few minutes before the termination of the
labour. 6. When the hemorrhage or lochial discharges are too profuse
immediately after delivery, and the uterus continues dilated and relaxed
without any ability to contract.]</p>

from Senna leaves, that there is no difficulty in at once recognising
them. The <em>Tripoli Senna</em> contains a much larger proportion of <em>Cynanchum</em>,

the affinities of its constituent parts balanced, that the application of a
very moderate temperature is sufficient to subvert them, and to occasion
partial decomposition. Mr. Phillips states that although he has seen what
he believes to be real bi-carbonate in the state of the moist crystals, yet he
has never met with any that was dry which had not lost one-fourth of its

53·45 of soda; according to the new theory, however, this salt must be
considered as a true <em>muriate of soda</em>, only while it remains in aqueous solution;
for when it is reduced to dryness, the muriatic acid and the soda
become both decomposed, and the hydrogen of the former uniting with
the oxygen of the latter, they pass off in the form of water, while the
chlorine of the muriatic acid unites with the metallic base of the soda, to
form <em>chloride of sodium</em>, which consists of an atom of each constituent.
It is perhaps difficult to believe that the same salt should be chloride of sodium
in the hand, and muriate of soda in the mouth! but it is not the less
true, nor is it more incredible than the change which Sulphuret of potass
undergoes by solution, the decomposition of which is rendered evident to
the senses by the evolved sulphuretted hydrogen. Late researches have
also detected both in <em>rock</em> and in other salt, the presence of <em>muriate of potass</em>,

many pounds of common salt with great success in worm cases. In the

I beg also to refer the practitioner to another case illustrative of its anthelmintic
powers, published by Mr. Marshall, (<cite>London Medical and Physical

antipathy to salt, and was in consequence most dreadfully infested with
worms during the whole of her life. In very large doses <em>Salt</em> proves purgative;
it is also absorbed, and carried to the kidneys, but it undergoes no

with animal substances, which always contain it, while on the contrary,
no portion of potass is found in them. Sir Gilbert Blane assumes
an opposite opinion, and observes that, as far as he can judge of the comparative
powers of the two fixed alkalies, he should greatly prefer Potass
to Soda, as a remedy for gravel, one reason of which he thinks may be
found in the fact that the Soda is an element of the animal fluids, since it
enters largely into the composition of bile, so that it is more likely to be arrested
in the course of the circulation and diverted from the urinary organs.
A gentleman, says Sir Gilbert, who was subject to frequent fits of gravel,
and in the habit of making experiments on the small concretions which he
passed, found that Soda dissolved them, but that Potass did not; nevertheless
he experienced sensible relief, and even temporary cure, from the
internal use of the latter alkali, but no benefit from the former. Are then
the absorbents more disposed to take up soda than potass? The results
of experience do not appear to sanction such a conclusion. <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span>

lotions. See <em>Form. 147, 148</em>. It has lately been ascertained by Mr.
Ritchie of Perth, that “<em>the degree of cold induced by the evaporation of spirit
of different degrees of strength are proportional to the strength of these spirits,
reckoning from the degrees of cold induced by the evaporation of water</em>.” The
application of this theorem will enable us to ascertain the strength of a spirit

<p class='c007'>This is rectified spirit diluted with a certain proportion of water, and it
is to be regretted that the quantity ordered for this purpose, should vary in
the different Pharmacopœias; thus, according to the London and Dublin
Colleges, its specific gravity is ·930, while the College of Edinburgh directs
it to be of ·935. The former consists of 44 per cent. of pure alcohol,
and may be formed by mixing <em>four</em> parts, by measure, of rectified spirit,
with <em>three</em> of water; the latter contains only 42 <em>per cent.</em> of pure alcohol,
and may be made by adding together <em>equal parts</em> of rectified spirit and distilled
water. Alcohol in this state of dilution, is better adapted for taking
up the principles of vegetables than rectified spirit; indeed, diluted alcohol
acts upon bodies as a chemical compound, and will dissolve what neither
the same proportion of water nor of alcohol would, if separately applied;
we perceive therefore the importance of ensuring uniformity of strength
in our spirits. (See <em>Tincturæ</em>.) It is necessary to remark that almost
all the spirit sold under the name of “<em>Proof Spirit</em>,” is contaminated
with empyreumatic oil, and is unfit for the purposes of pharmacy; it
ought therefore to be extemporaneously prepared by mixing together rectified
spirit and water, in the proportions above stated. This however is
rarely done, except the liquors are intended for the toilet, and hence it has
been observed, that the cordials of the apothecary are generally less grateful
than those of the distiller, the latter being extremely curious in rectifying
and purifying his spirit. If common water be employed for the dilution
of alcohol, the resulting spirit will be turbid, owing principally to the
precipitation of sulphuric salts; this circumstance lately occasioned considerable
embarrassment to the Curators of the Hunterian Museum at the
College of Surgeons, who were compelled to prepare their own spirit, in
consequence of an excise regulation preventing the distiller from sending
out any spirit of that strength which is required for their anatomical purposes.
A curious fact has just been noticed in the Laboratory of the Royal
Institution, which is, that diluted spirit <em>becomes stronger</em> by being kept
in vessels that are carefully closed by bladder! whence it would seem, that
alcoholic vapour transpires through this animal membrane less freely than
aqueous vapour; we are at present unable to offer a satisfactory explanation
of this anomalous case of distillation, but it is probably connected with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>the different solvent powers of these two liquids, in relation to the animal
membrane. <span class='sc'>Med. Uses.</span> Alcohol, although diluted to the degree of
proof spirit, is still too strong for internal exhibition; indeed, where its use
is indicated, it is more generally given in the form of wine, malt liquors, or
ardent spirits, which must be regarded only as diluted alcohol, although
each has a peculiarity of operation, owing to the modifying influence of
the other elements of the liquid; thus <em>Brandy</em><a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c015'><sup>[647]</sup></a> is said to be simply cordial
and stomachic;<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c015'><sup>[648]</sup></a> <em>Rum</em>,<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c015'><sup>[649]</sup></a> heating and sudorific; <em>Gin</em> and <em>Whiskey</em>, diuretic;
and <em>Arrack</em>,<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c015'><sup>[650]</sup></a> styptic, heating, and narcotic; it seems also probable
that a modified effect is produced by the addition of various other substances,
such as sugar and acids, which latter bodies, besides their anti-narcotic
powers, appear to act by favouring a more perfect combination
and mutual penetration of the particles of spirit and water. Foreign brandy
derives its colour from the oak cask, the intensity of which, therefore,
affords some criterion of its age. The English have been in the habit of
colouring their spirits with burnt sugar until lately, but now since the
cause of the foreign colour is discovered, the scrapings of gall-nuts are
employed for that purpose, whence the sulphate of iron is no longer a test
of brandy being genuine.<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c015'><sup>[651]</sup></a> The effects, also, which are produced by the
habitual use of fermented liquors, differ essentially according to the kind
that is drunk; thus Ale and Porter, in consequence of the nutritive matter,
and perhaps the invigorating bitter with which they are charged, and
the comparatively small proportion of alcohol which they contain, dispose
to a plethora, which is not unfrequently terminated by apoplexy; Spirits,
on the other hand, induce severe dyspepsia, obstructed and hardened liver,
dropsy, and more than half of all our chronical diseases; and Dr. Darwin
moreover remarks that when they arise from this cause, they are liable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>become hereditary, even to the third generation, gradually increasing, if
the cause be continued, till the family become extinct; with regard to
Wine, Rush has truly observed that its effects, like those of tyranny in a
well formed government, are first felt in the extremities, while spirits like
a bold invader, seize at once upon the vitals of the constitution; the different
kinds of wine, however, produce very different and even opposite
effects, as stated under the history of that article, (see <em>Vinum</em>.) The excise
officers frequently avail themselves of the peculiar power of the sub-acetate
of lead to precipitate colouring matter, in order to remove from
seized Holland Gin, the colour which it contains by being long kept in
the tubs in which it is smuggled over. This practice, however, renders
the gin liable to gripe.</p>

is a powerful solvent of all sulphureous substances. In boiling oil of turpentine
it is entirely soluble. <span class='sc'>Medicinal Uses.</span> It is laxative and diaphoretic;
it acts principally upon the large intestines, and very mildly,
whence it proves useful in hæmorrhoidal affections (<em>Form. 74</em>); and in
consequence of the diaphoresis which it also excites, it is useful in chronic
rheumatisms, catarrhs, and in some cutaneous affections.<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c015'><sup>[654]</sup></a> To promote
its purgative effects, <em>magnesia</em> will be found a serviceable adjunct in hæmorrhoids;
it may be given in the form of an electuary, or suspended in
milk; its solution in oil (<em>Oleum Sulphuratum</em>) is a most nauseous and acrid
preparation. When sulphur is combined with metallic remedies, it generally
lessens their activity. Its effects in curing psora are universally admitted,
and the only objection to its use is the disgusting smell which
accompanies its application; see <em>Unguent: Sulphuris</em>. Dr. Clarke of
Dublin recommends a lotion which he says contains a sufficient impregnation
of sulphur for the cure of psora in children, to be made by adding
an ounce of broken sulphur to a quart of boiling water, and allowing it to
infuse for twelve hours. In this process, the water probably takes up a
small portion of sulphurous acid; it is difficult to explain the efficacy of
the lotion in any other manner. When sulphur is internally administered,
it transpires through the skin in the state of sulphuretted hydrogen, and
blackens the silver in the pockets of those who take it. <span class='sc'>Dose</span> ʒj to ʒiij.

contains a small quantity of sulphate of lime, and not unfrequently other
impurities; it may be assayed by pouring upon a suspected sample a
sufficient quantity of <em>liquor potassæ</em> to cover it, and setting it aside in a
warm place to digest, when the sulphur will be dissolved and the impurities
remain; or it might be at once subjected to the operation of heat;
which would volatilize the sulphur, and thus separate it from its contaminations.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are solutions of sugar in water, watery infusions, or in vegetable
juices; the proportion of sugar is generally <em>two parts</em> to one of the

and become acescent.<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c015'><sup>[655]</sup></a> The most certain test of the proper consistence
of a syrup is its specific gravity; a bottle that holds three ounces of water
at 55 <em>Fah.</em> ought to hold four ounces of syrup. Syrups are introduced
into medicinal formulæ for several purposes, viz.</p>

<p class='c007'>I. <em>To correct or disguise the flavour of disagreeable remedies.</em> Syrup:
Aurantiorum. L.D. (<em>Form, 48, 51, 107</em>.)—Limonum, L.E.D.—Simplex

L.D. (166, 168.)—Caryophylli Rubri. D.—Violæ. E. Except that of
Saffron, these syrups are rendered green by alkalies, and red by acids.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>General Remarks.</span> The practitioner should never introduce syrups
into those medicines which are liable to be injured by the generation of
acids: I have frequently seen the <em>cretaceous mixture</em>, when charged with
syrup. Increase, instead of check, a diarrhœa; and the syrup of poppies,
from its disposition to become acescent, will often aggravate rather than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>allay the cholic of infants. The syrup of Senna furnishes the practitioner
with a convenient purgative for children; that of buckthorn is
more violent, and is on that account but rarely used; besides which, in
preparing it the chemist not unfrequently substitutes the berries of the
<em>Cornus Sanguinea</em>, the Dogberry-tree, or those of the <em>Rhamnus Frangula</em>,
the Alder-buckthorn, for the Rhamnus Catharticus; a circumstance which
necessarily renders the efficacy of this syrup variable and uncertain; it is
moreover often sophisticated with treacle and jalap. The syrup of the
rose, when made with the leaves of the <em>Damask</em><a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c015'><sup>[656]</sup></a> rose, is gently laxative,
and is well adapted for weak children; it is however not unusual,
<em>coloris gratia</em>, to substitute the leaves of the <em>red</em> rose, in which case the
syrup will possess astringent instead of laxative properties. In the preparation
of the syrup of poppies,<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c015'><sup>[657]</sup></a> the directions of the College are frequently
not obeyed; it is sometimes made by dissolving the extract in
syrup, formed with coarse sugar, or even with treacle; at others, by adding
tincture of opium to a coarse syrup, in the proportion of ♏︎x to every
f℥j. In the preparation of the syrups of violets, the juice of red cabbage
is generally substituted; this is at least a harmless fraud. <span class='sc'>Note.</span> The
syrups which are printed in <em>Italics</em>, are very susceptible of decomposition,
and should be kept in cool places.</p>

Vauquelin considers it as approaching the volatile oils in its properties; it
is colourless, has an acrid taste, and the peculiar smell of tobacco, and occasions
violent sneezing; with alcohol and water, it produces colourless
solutions, from which it is thrown down by tincture of galls. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span>
Tobacco yields its active matter both to water and spirit, but more perfectly
to the latter; long coction weakens its powers. An oil of tobacco
of a most powerful nature, may be obtained by distilling the leaves and
separating it from the water, on the top of which it will be found to float.<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c015'><sup>[659]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span><span class='sc'>Med. Uses.</span> Tobacco is endued with energetic poisonous properties, producing
generally a universal tremor which is rarely the result of other
poisons; the experiments of M. Orfila moreover demonstrate, that the action
of Tobacco is much more energetic when the soluble portion is injected
into the anus, than when it is applied to the cellular texture, and for a still
stronger reason, than when introduced into the stomach. Mr. Brodie,
from the result of a well devised experiment, has deduced the conclusion
that the infusion of Tobacco acts upon the heart, occasioning syncope,
through the medium of the nervous system. <span class='sc'>Uses.</span> As a powerful sedative,
it is sometimes valuable in medical practice; the leaves, when applied
in the form of a cataplasm to the pit of the stomach, produce an emetic
operation; (<em>Form. 67.</em>) In cases of obstinate constipation, depending
upon violent spasmodic constriction, or in <em>ileus</em>, or <em>incarcerated hernia</em>, clysters
of the smoke of Tobacco, or of an infusion made according to the London
College, produce almost immediate relief, (<em>Form. 26.</em>); the practice
is not unfrequently attended with severe vomiting, extreme debility, and
cold sweats, circumstances which render its administration highly dangerous
in cases wherein the patient has been already exhausted by previous
suffering. I remember witnessing a lamentable instance of this truth some
years ago; a medical practitioner, after repeated trials to reduce a strangulated
hernia, injected an infusion of Tobacco, and shortly afterwards
sent the patient in a carriage to the Westminster Hospital, for the purpose
of undergoing the operation; but the unfortunate man arrived only a few
minutes before he expired. Clysters of Tobacco were some years ago recommended
in America, for the purpose of forwarding difficult parturition,
by inducing relaxation and consequent dilatation of the <em>os uteri</em>, but the
alarming symptoms which followed the single case in which Tobacco was
thus employed, ought, says <em>Dr. Merriman</em>, to prevent a repetition of the
experiment.<a id='r660' /><a href='#f660' class='c015'><sup>[660]</sup></a> It was also formerly proposed to inject infusions of Tobacco,
for the purpose of recovering persons in a state of <em>asphyxia</em> from drowning;
it is difficult to explain how such an idea could have entered into
the mind of the rational physiologist. Smoking or chewing Tobacco has
been also advised in cases of spasmodic asthma, and as a general sedative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>to relieve suffering; in the process of <em>smoking</em>, the oil is separated, and being
rendered empyreumatic by heat, it is thus applied to the fauces in its
most active state. As a diuretic it was successfully exhibited by Dr.
Fowler, but as its operation is uncertain and violent, and appears to be very
analogous to that of Digitalis, which is far more safe and manageable,
it has been very judiciously discarded from practice. The external application
of Tobacco in the form of cataplasm or infusion, has been applied to
several species of cutaneous disease, but even in this state it is liable to exert
its virulent effects. A woman applied to the heads of three children
afflicted with <em>tinea capitis</em>, a liniment consisting of powdered tobacco and
butter, soon after which they experienced vertigo, violent vomiting, and
fainting. (<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ephemerides des Curieux de la Nature</span></cite>, Dec. ii. An: i. p. 46.)
A case has just occurred in this country of a child whose death was occasioned
by her having swallowed a portion of half-smoked tobacco, which
was taken from the pipe of her father, and in which there no doubt existed
a quantity of essential oil, which had been separated by the act of smoking.
It is a curious fact, that the juice of the green leaves instantly cures
the stinging of nettles.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> When it exhales a fetid odour, we may infer that it
has been badly prepared, and not deprived of all its mucus; when pungent,
the presence of some deleterious drug is indicated: Cascarilla is very
usually added to impart a peculiar flavour; Nitre is also employed for the
sake of making it kindle more rapidly, and to impress a lively sensation on
the tongue; its vapour is of course very injurious to the lungs: its presence
may be detected by treating a suspected sample with hot water,
and after filtering the solution through charcoal, setting it aside in order
that it may yield its crystals by evaporation. Traces of <em>Lead</em>, <em>Copper</em>, or
<em>Antimony</em>, may be discovered by boiling the Tobacco in strong vinegar,
and, after filtering it as before, by assaying it with appropriate tests.
<em>Black Hellebore</em>, <em>Alum</em>, <em>Sugar</em>, and <em>Corrosive sublimate</em> are amongst the
more usual sophistications. <em>Dried Dock</em> leaves are also sometimes substituted.

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Snuff.</span> This well known errhine is prepared from the dried leaves of
Tobacco; in its manufacture however, numerous additions are made
which are kept secret. <em>Salt</em> is added for the purpose of increasing its
weight; <em>Urine</em>, Muriate of ammonia, and powdered Glass, to heighten its
acrimony. The varied flavour of different <em>Snuffs</em> is owing to the leaf being
in greater or less perfection; or to its having undergone some degree
of fermentation; thus, for instance, the <em>Macouba Snuff</em> of Martinique is
principally indebted for its acknowledged superiority to the fermentation
which the Tobacco undergoes, from being moistened with the best cane
juice; other kinds are excited into fermentation by moistening them with
melasses and water.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Most species of Pinus<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c015'><sup>[664]</sup></a> may be made to yield (and many of them produce
spontaneously) a remarkable resinous juice, usually called <em>Turpentine:</em>
an appellation, however, which more properly belongs to the product
of a different genus, called by Linnæus <em>Pistachia</em>, which contains the
true <em>Terebinthus</em><a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c015'><sup>[665]</sup></a> of the ancients.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> <em>Consistence</em>, semifluid and tenacious, but becoming more
or less concrete by age; <em>Odour</em>, aromatic; <em>Taste</em>, pungent, austere, and
astringent. It is inflammable. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> It is entirely soluble in rectified
spirit, but not at all in water; although it becomes miscible with that
fluid, by the mediation of the yelk or the white of an egg, but more elegantly
by that of vegetable mucilage, and forms a milky liquor. It is capable of
entering into union with fixed oils. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> Resin, and
an essential oil, the proportions of which vary according to the species of
Pine from which it is obtained. They all, however, possess the same general
chemical, as well as medicinal properties, viz. When internally taken,
says Dr. Maton, they seem to warm the <em>viscera</em>, raise the pulse, and
impart additional excitement to the vascular system; applied externally,
they increase the tone of the part, counteract indolence of action, and deterge,
as it were, ill-conditioned ulcers. <em>Internal</em> ulcerations indeed, especially
of the urinary passages, as well as laxities of the seminal and uterine
vessels, are supposed to be diminished by the exhibition of preparations
of this nature. They certainly appear to act in a peculiar manner on the
urinary organs, impregnating the water with a violet smell, and there are
strong grounds for believing that its volatile element, developed by the
powers of digestion, passes into the circulation, and is eliminated by the
kidneys, whose secreting vessels are thus stimulated <em>by its contact</em>. (<em>Page
93.</em>) Pulmonary complaints, as obstinate coughs and asthmatic affections,
have been said to give way to medicines of this class; yet, in modern
practice, recourse is rarely had to them in such cases, and their exhibition
is even considered hazardous. The ancients were accustomed to
medicate their wines with various Terebinthinate substances, for the effect
of which, see <em>Vinum</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The particular preparations of Turpentine most employed in medicine,
will be noticed under the different species.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <span class='sc'>Terebinthina Canadensis</span>. L. (Pinus Balsamea. <em>Resina Liquida.</em>)
<em>Canada Turpentine</em>, or <em>Canada Balsam</em>.<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c015'><sup>[666]</sup></a> This is a transparent
whitish juice, brought to this country from Canada, and apparently, says
Dr. Maton, not very different in its qualities from the celebrated <em>Balm of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>Gilead</em>,<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c015'><sup>[667]</sup></a> so high in esteem among the eastern nations, and so strongly recommended
in a variety of complaints. Hitherto, however, it has not been
much employed in England. Its odour is agreeable, and its taste strong
and pungent.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <span class='sc'>Terebinthina Chia.</span> L. (Pistachia Terebinthus.) <em>Chio</em>, or <em>Cyprus
Turpentine</em>. The superiority of this species to all the products of the
pine tribe, was well known to, and described by, most of the ancient writers
on the materia medica. It is pellucid, with a bluish-green cast.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <span class='sc'>Terebinthina Vulgaris.</span> L. (Pinus Sylvestris. <em>Scotch Fir.</em>)
<em>Common Turpentine.</em> <em>Horse Turpentine.</em> This species is more coarse and
dense than any other kind, and has an opaque light brown colour; its
consistence may be compared to that of honey; the taste is very acrid,
hot, and disagreeable, and the smell much less pleasant than either the
<em>Venice</em> or the <em>Strasburg</em> turpentine. It is the kind which, as its name implies,
is most commonly employed, and although inferior in quality to that
of the turpentine tree, <em>Pistachia Terebinthus</em> (Chio or Cyprus), the Larch,
<em>Pinus Larix</em> (Venice Turpentine), and the Silver Fir, <em>Pinus Picea</em>
(Strasburgh Turpentine), especially for internal use, yet it is too often
substituted for them in the shops of the druggist. The Colleges of London
and Edinburgh direct the common turpentine to be used chiefly in external
applications, for which it was also much employed by the ancients.
Celsus mentions, “<em>Resina liquida pinea</em>,” as entering into the composition
of many of his “<em>Malagmata</em>,” and the “<em>Resina liquida</em>,” of other writers
would appear to be of the same kind. The <em>Unguentum Elemi compositum</em>
contains this resinous juice as a principal ingredient.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <span class='sc'>Terebinthina Veneta.</span> (Pinus Larix.)<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c015'><sup>[668]</sup></a> <em>The Larch.</em> <em>Venice
Turpentine.</em> The resin is by most writers, and in the shops, esteemed the
best, after that of <em>Pistachia Terebinthus</em>, of those juices commonly called
<em>Turpentines</em>. It is usually thinner than any other kind, of a pale yellowish
colour, and of a hot, pungent, bitterish taste; the smell is strong, and
far from being agreeable. Although it bears the name of <em>Venice Turpentine</em>,
very little of it is exported from the Venetian territories; but it is probable
that the merchants of that country were the first who substituted it
for the genuine Turpentine of Cyprus. The resinous juice of the Larch
is said to remain always, or at least a very long time, in a state of liquidity;
a property which is particularly adverted to by Pliny.<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c015'><sup>[669]</sup></a> As a Diuretic,
the <em>Venice</em> Turpentine has been generally preferred to all the other
kinds; and it is said to relax the bowels more, for which reason <em>Riverius</em><a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c015'><sup>[670]</sup></a>
considers it as being safer than other irritating diuretics.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. <span class='sc'>Terebinthina Argentoratensis.</span> (Pinus Picea.) <em>Strasburg
Turpentine.</em> This resin is generally of a middle consistence between that
of the <em>Terebinthus</em> and the <em>Larix</em>; more transparent and less tenacious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>than either; in colour yellowish brown; in smell more agreeable than
any other turpentine, except the Cyprian; in taste the bitterest, yet the
least acrid.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Form of Exhibition.</em> The Turpentines may be either made into Pills
with powdered liquorice root, or suspended in water by the intervention of
egg or mucilage; for which purpose, ℥j requires the yelk of one egg, or
ʒiss of gum arabic. <em>Dose</em>, gr. x to ʒj.</p>

    <div>TEREBINTHINÆ OLEUM. L.E.D.</div>
    <div class='c004'><em>Oil of Turpentine.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> <em>Form</em>, a limpid and colourless liquid, whose specific gravity
is only ·792; <em>Odour</em>, strong, penetrating, and peculiar; <em>Taste</em>, hot,
bitter and pungent. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span> It is an essential oil, possessing,
however, peculiar habitudes with respect to alcohol, being readily
dissolved by <em>hot</em> alcohol, but separating again in drops, as the spirit cools;
in the cold it is sparingly soluble in the strongest alcohol, and separates
from it on standing; but it dissolves completely in six parts of sulphuric
æther. It is not acted upon by the alkalies, except by long triture, when
it is converted into a species of resin.<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c015'><sup>[671]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Med. Uses.</span> It acts according
to the dose, either on the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i> producing catharsis, or on the kidneys,
exciting diuresis; thus its operation offers another illustration of the views
which I have so frequently urged during the progress of the present
work; it furnishes a striking example of the important influence of quantity,
or <em>dose</em>, in determining the specific operation of a remedy; thus <em>two
fluid-drachms</em> of the oil may so excite the urinary organs as to produce
even bloody urine, and the other ill effects described by Boerhaave and
Lange; whereas <em>six fluid-drachms</em>, or a <em>fluid-ounce</em>, will stimulate the
bowels, and produce scarcely any apparent effect upon the kidneys.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a medicine acting powerfully on the first passages, its value seems
only to have been lately appreciated; in Tænia, it may be said to act
almost as a specific remedy, discharging it in all cases, <em>dead</em>. In obstinate
constipation, depending on affections of the brain, I have lately had several
opportunities or witnessing its beneficial effects; in an unfortunate instance
of <em>Hydrocephalus acutus</em> in a boy of thirteen years of age,<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c015'><sup>[672]</sup></a> it brought
away an accumulation of feculent matter almost incredible as to quantity,
after the total failure of the strongest doses of ordinary purgatives; and,
I believe, if its dose be sufficiently large, that it may generally be administered
with perfect safety and confidence. Dr. Latham has long regarded
it as a valuable medicine in Epilepsy, in which cases it may in the first
instance prove beneficial by unloading the bowels, and subsequently in
producing an affection of the head peculiar to its use; and, which generally
succeeds a large dose, it is an approach to intoxication, but is
unaccompanied with that hilarity and elevation of thought that so usually
follow the potation of spirituous liquors. In small doses it produces
diuresis, and is used with much advantage in sciatica and lumbago.<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c015'><sup>[673]</sup></a> Its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>use in diseases of the kidneys originating from ulcerations and obstructions
in those organs has been very highly extolled. Cheyne, in his Essay
on the gout, recommends it as a specific in Sciatica; upon this subject
my own experience so completely confirms the truth of Dr. Maton’s
observations, that I shall here insert them. “If,” says he, “I may be allowed
to offer the result of my own practice, its effects are in a few instances
successful in the removal of that disease; and even those cases
which I have seen cured under its use, appeared to be rather of the symptomatic
than idiophatic kind; it is reasonable to presume that the sciatic
nerve, from its origin and course, may owe some of its morbid affections
to an obstructed ureter, as well as to a rheumatic diathesis.” <em>Form: 50.</em>
Hunter spoke of oil of turpentine as a styptic, and it has been administered
in the Almond emulsion in cases of internal hemorrhage of an active
nature. We should however be very careful how we make such an experiment.
This oil has the effect of communicating the odour of violets
to the urine of those who take it, and what is still more extraordinary, to
those even who merely expose themselves for a short time to its effluvia:<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c015'><sup>[674]</sup></a>
a mixture of ♏︎x of this oil with f℥j of almond oil, introduced upon cotton
into the ears, is serviceable in cases of deafness resulting from a diseased
action of the ceruminiferous glands; it is also employed as a local stimulant
in a variety of cases: and in cholic, and obstinate constipation, it
is sometimes exhibited in the form of an enema. In America, oil of Turpentine,
in doses of a drachm every hour or two, has been successfully administered
in cases of Yellow fever, when, says Dr. Chapman, it appears
to be soothing in its effects, removing the sense of heat and irritation
in the stomach, subduing the force of vascular action and general
excitement, and inducing at once a condition of more comfort and security.
Orfila also recommends it as the best corrective of inflammation in
the stomach from acrid poisons. In this country it has been very successfully
employed in cases of Melæna, and in Puerperal fever. As a
stimulating liniment its advantages are considerable, see <em>Liniment: Terebinth:</em>
In Germany, Norway, and some parts of the Russian Empire, this
essential oil is frequently used as a remedy for lesions of the tendons, and
other bruises.<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c015'><sup>[675]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Dose</span> as an anthelmintic, f℥ss-f℥ij, repeated every eight
hours until the worm is ejected; in these large quantities it is more convenient,
as well as more efficacious, to administer it like castor oil, floating
upon some liquid aromatic vehicle:<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c015'><sup>[676]</sup></a> by rubbing up Oil of Turpentine
with mucilage, we do but render it more pungent, and difficult to swallow.
As a diuretic or stimulant it may be given in the form of an electuary,
in doses of from ♏︎x to fʒj. It may be also employed as a very
active clyster, made by carefully incorporating one or two table spoonsful
of the oil with the yelk of an egg, and adding to it a pint of thin mucilage.
This terebinthinate clyster is well calculated to relieve a paroxysm
of flatulent cholic. <span class='sc'>Officinal Prep.</span> <em>Liniment. Terebinth</em>. L. The
Pharmacopœias direct the rectification of the oil by redistillation,<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c015'><sup>[677]</sup></a> when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>it is commonly called <em>Spirit</em> of turpentine, but it appears to be an unnecessary
refinement. Dr. Nimmo has proposed the following process for
purifying the oil intended for medicinal use, by which it is said to have its
disagreeable flavour lessened without sustaining any loss of efficacy. To
eight parts of the oil, add one part of the strongest alcohol, and let them
be well agitated together. In a few minutes a separation takes place;
the oil, unless very impure, falls to the bottom, and the alcohol, having
discharged the impurities, floats at the top. Pour off the alcoholic portion,
add a similar quantity of alcohol, and proceed as before. If this be
repeated three or four times, the oil will become nearly tasteless, almost
inodorous, and when evaporated will leave no residuum. But pure as
the oil may be thus rendered, it speedily returns to its original condition.</p>

    <div>TIGLII OLEUM. L. Oil of Tiglium.</div>
    <div class='c004'>Croton Tiglium. <em>Oleum e Seminibus expressum.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Croton Tiglium</em> is a native of the island of Ceylon, and is found in
Malabar, China, Cochinchina, and the Molucca Islands. Every part of
the plant would seem to be endowed with medicinal activity; the <em>root</em>
acts as a drastic purgative, and when pulverized, and exhibited in the dose
of a few grains, is considered at Amboyna and Batavia, as a specific for
dropsy; the <em>wood</em> (<em>lignum Pavanæ</em>) produces, when administered in small
doses, a diaphoretic effect, and in larger ones it proves drastic; the <em>leaves</em>
are also purgative, and when dried and powdered are supposed to afford
an antidote against the bite of the <em>cobra del Capella</em>. The <em>seeds</em>, however,
are the parts which have been more generally employed in medicine, the
effects of which appear to have been well known for nearly a thousand
years.[A] They were early introduced into Europe, and long known under
the names of <em>Grana Molucca</em>—<em>Tilii Grana</em>—and <em>Grana Tiglia</em>.<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c015'><sup>[678]</sup></a> It appears
that they were at first very frequently administered, but their extreme
acrimony and violence,<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c015'><sup>[679]</sup></a> and probably the accidents which arose from their
injudicious use, soon banished the article from medical practice; in India,
however these seeds are still employed as an effectual purgative, after first
undergoing the process of roasting, or baking, for the purpose of removing
the shell, rendering the nut pulverulent, and at the same time of moderating
the acrimonious qualities.<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c015'><sup>[680]</sup></a> The expressed oil of these seeds does not
appear to have been obtained in a separate form until a later period; Lemery
speaks of it, and Geoffroy in directing its dose cautions us against
giving more than ʒj!—he probably meant a drop. Its use has very lately
been revived, and there can be little doubt but that under proper restrictions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>it may become a valuable acquisition to the practitioner. The
profession is indebted for its late introduction, or rather revival, to Mr. E.
Conwell, of the East India Company’s Medical Service, on the Madras
Establishment, who,<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c015'><sup>[681]</sup></a> having for many years prescribed it with advantage,
introduced a quantity of it for trial in London, through the medium of his
friend, Mr. Short, of Ratcliffe Highway.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Qualities.</span> This expressed oil has a yellow colour, a faint odour, and
an acrid taste; these qualities however will be found to vary in different
samples; but the fact, as Dr. Nimmo<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c015'><sup>[682]</sup></a> has justly observed, may be fairly
explained, without suspecting the existence of any fraud, by supposing
that the seeds have undergone a different degree of torrefaction, in order
to separate the oil from the farinaceous part. <span class='sc'>Chemical Composition.</span>
The recent experiments of Dr. Nimmo have very satisfactorily shewn that
this oil consists of 45 parts of an <em>Acrid purgative principle</em>, and 55 of a fixed
oil resembling that of olives, and not possessed of any cathartic property.
The acrid principle appears to reside in a resinous matter soluble in alcohol
and sulphuric æther, and in volatile and fixed oils. I have lately repeated
some of Dr. Nimmo’s experiments on a recently imported sample of
oil, and with similar results. The acrid principle appears to bear a strong
analogy to that which I separated from elaterium, and as I gave to this
latter principle the term <em>Elatin</em>, it seems to me that we might with much
propriety, apply the name <em>Tiglin</em> to the former, especially as it does not
appear to possess any of the characters and habitudes of a salifiable basis;
at all events the adoption of such a term will obviate the necessity of circumlocution
in our descriptions. <span class='sc'>Solubility.</span> By alcohol the oil undergoes
a ready decomposition; the <em>Tiglin</em> is dissolved together with a very
minute quantity of the oily part. Ether and oil of turpentine dissolve the
whole; a fact which enables us, by digesting the seeds in these menstrua,
to obtain the article in as genuine, and certainly in a much more uniform,
condition, than by the processes of torrefaction and expression, as practised
in India; for this fact we are also indebted to Dr. Nimmo. <span class='sc'>Med. Uses.</span>
As far as I have been able to ascertain the fact, this oil does not appear
to produce any effects which cannot be commanded by other drastic purgatives;
its value depends upon the facility with which it may be administered;
in some cases it is amply sufficient to touch the tongue, in others,
a drop or two will be required. In maniacs, and in cases where the administration
of bulky medicines is extremely difficult, it would seem to offer a
decided advantage.<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c015'><sup>[683]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Forms of Exhibition.</span> It has been usually given in
this country in the proportion of from one to two drops, in the form of pills.
Dr. Nimmo’s discovery with respect to the chemical composition of the oil,
very naturally suggested to him the mode of administering it in the form of
an alcoholic tincture, (<em>Tinctura Tiglii</em>,) and he has found by experience that
such a preparation furnishes the means of readily apportioning the dose to
the various circumstances of the case; thus he found that in administering
a tincture<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c015'><sup>[684]</sup></a> in doses equivalent to the number of drops decomposed, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>same effects were produced as have been attributed to the entire oil.
<span class='sc'>Adulterations.</span> Much has been said upon the fraudulent admixture of
this comparatively expensive article with the cheaper fixed oils; and we
believe with much truth; a circumstance which will of necessity prevent
the general use of the article; and occasion very different reports with respect
to its value and activity. Dr. Nimmo however proposes a method of
detecting such adulteration, by a process suggested by the results of his experiments
upon its composition, and whose rationalé will be easily understood
after the chemical history that has been just presented.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let a very light phial be counterpoised in an accurate balance; pour into
it 50 grains of the suspected oil, add alcohol (which has been previously
digested<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c015'><sup>[685]</sup></a> upon olive oil,) agitate them well, pour off the solution and add
more alcohol as before, until the dissolved portion is diffused in such a
proportion of alcohol that each half drachm measure shall contain equal
to one dose of the oil of <em>Tiglium</em> for an adult. By afterwards placing the
phial near a fire, to evaporate what remains of the alcohol in the bottle, <em>if
the residuum be to that which has been abstracted by the alcohol as</em> 55 to 45, <em>the
oil is genuine</em>. If olive, or any other oil little soluble in alcohol, has been
employed as the adulterating agent, it is evident that the residuum will
be in a larger proportion; but should <em>Castor Oil</em> have been employed for
that purpose, the proportion of the residuum will be smaller even than in
the genuine medicine.”</p>

    <div>TINCTURÆ. L.E.D. <em>Tinctures.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These consist of alcohol, proof spirit, or spirit of greater or less density,
holding in solution one or more of those proximate principles of vegetable
or animal matter which are soluble in that menstruum, viz; <em>Sugar</em>, <em>resin</em>,
<em>extractive</em>, <em>tannin</em>, <em>cinchonia</em>, <em>camphor</em>, <em>volatile oils</em>, <em>morphia</em>, <em>emetin</em>, <em>conein</em>, <em>elatin</em>,
<em>tiglin</em>, and <em>several acids</em>. The proper solvent of those bodies, termed
gum-resins, appears to be proof spirit. The compilers of the <cite>Codex Medicamentarius</cite>
of Paris, have defined the different degrees of spirituous
strength requisite for the full and perfect extraction of the active elements
of different bodies with great truth and nicety; thus they direct for these
purposes a spirit of three different standards, viz. 36 (<em>Sp.</em> <em>gr.</em> ·837,) 32
(·856) 22, (·915) of Beaumé’s hydrometer; with the first are prepared the
<em>resinous</em> tinctures; with the second those wherein the <em>resinous</em>, <em>extractive</em>,
or <em>gummy</em> elements, hold nearly an equal place; and with the third those
in which the latter predominate. We are moreover indebted to this committee
for having set at rest a question which has been long doubtful,
whether the addition of alkaline agents increases the extractive powers of
the spirit? They have indeed ascertained by experiment, that the reverse
not frequently obtains; for instance, they found that a smaller proportion
of <em>guaiacum</em> was dissolved by the spirit of ammonia, than by alcohol of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>same strength, and that the quantity of matter dissolved from the <em>root of
Valerian</em> was the same in both cases. Very active substances, soluble in
alcohol, are those which are particularly adapted for tinctures, since they
furnish preparations which are efficient in small doses, and very manageable
in extemporaneous prescription, such are the tinctures of <em>Opium</em>, <em>Digitalis</em>,
<em>Hyoscyamus</em>, <em>Scilla</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em> and from the chemical analysis of <em>Elaterium</em>,
there can be no doubt but that a very active and useful tincture of
that substance might be introduced into practice; while Dr. Nimmo has
very clearly proved that the active matter of the <em>Croton Tiglium</em> may be
thus concentrated, see <em>Tiglii Oleum</em>. On the contrary, substances of little
activity, except in large doses, are the least adapted for this form of exhibition,
as in such cases the solvent will act more powerfully on the living
system, than the principles which it may hold in solution, and when continued
for any length of time, will lay the foundation of the pernicious
custom of dram drinking; such tinctures, however, are not without their
value in combination; they sometimes increase the efficacy, and often
correct the operation or disguise the flavour, of the medicines with which
they may be united; for example, the cathartic tinctures in <em>Formula 70</em>,
augment the purgative powers of the combination, at the same time that
they correct its unpleasant operation; many other illustrations are presented
in the different formulæ, for the explanation of which I must refer
the student to the <em>Key Letters</em>. The addition of a tincture has likewise
the effect of preserving decoctions and infusions from spontaneous decomposition,
the <em>compound tincture of Cardamoms</em> answers such an object in the
<em>compound decoction of Aloes</em>. Tinctures are sometimes made with æther,
but they are generally more strongly characterised by the nature of the
menstruum than by that of the substance dissolved in it; indeed, æther is
used in these cases, not to dissolve substances which would resist the action
of alcohol and water, but for the sake of its own direct action on the
body; thus the Edinburgh pharmacopœia directs an <em>Æthereal Tincture of
Aloes</em>, which is more penetrating and stimulant than the alcoholic tinctures;
the London College, with the exception of the <em>Aromatic Spirit of
Æther</em>, does not recognise any preparation of this nature: I have already
alluded to the <em>Æthereal Tincture of Digitalis</em> of the French Codex, than
which nothing can be more injudicious, for the digitalis does not amount
to more than <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>70</span></span>th part of the tincture, and must therefore be entirely
counteracted by the stimulant effects of the menstruum. The same objection
cannot be urged against the æthereal tinctures of <em>Castor</em>, <em>Musk</em>,
and <em>Amber</em>, since in these cases, the subject and the menstruum concur in
their mode of operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tinctures derive their names from the substances which impart activity
to them, and as the medicinal history of each substance is detailed under
its proper head, it will be unnecessary to dwell at any length upon the
individual virtues of these tinctures.</p>

This is a combination of Benzoin, Storax, and Tolu, with aloes; it is regarded
as a stimulating expectorant, and has been used in chronic catarrh
and confirmed asthma, but it is now very rarely employed, except as an
application to wounds and languid ulcers. It is sold under the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span><em>Friar’s Balsam</em>; and with respect to the use of this preparation as a <em>Styptic</em>,
the public have fallen into a serious error; fresh wounds it must necessarily
injure, not only by its stimulating qualities, but by the separation
of the resins which take place on its intermixture with the blood; these
form a substance, which absolutely prevents what is most desirable in
such case,—the sides of the wound coming in contact and uniting by the
first intention. Dose. As an internal remedy from fʒss to fʒij, triturated
with yelk of egg, or mucilage, to suspend it in water.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Castorei.</span> L.E. <em>Dose</em>, ♏︎xx to fʒij. See Form 20, 23, 25,
76, 97, 136.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Castorei Composita.</span> E. This is much more active than
the preceding tincture, as it contains assafœtida, and its menstruum is
ammoniated alcohol. Dose ♏︎xv to fʒj.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Cinchonæ Ammoniata.</span> L. In this preparation we have
the tonic powers of the bark combined with the stimulus of the Ammonia.
<em>Dose</em>, fʒss to fʒij. Acids and Acidulous Salts are of course incompatible
with it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Guaiaci.</span> L.E.D. A simple solution of guaiac. <em>Dose</em>, fʒi-fʒiij.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Guaiaci Ammoniata.</span> This is a solution of the guaiac in
the aromatic spirit of ammonia, and is consequently more stimulating than
the preceding one, and more efficacious as a sudorific: after arterial action
is properly reduced, it is certainly one of our best remedies in rheumatism.
<em>Dose</em>, fʒj to fʒij, at bed time, and its effects should be promoted by some
warm beverage. It is worthy of remark, that nitrous acid and the spirit
of nitric æther occasion an extraordinary decomposition of these tinctures,
separating the guaiacum into coagulated masses, and imparting to the
whole an intense bluish green colour. I find that <em>chlorine</em> has the same
effect;<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c015'><sup>[686]</sup></a> but the sulphuric and muriatic acids produce no disturbance, although
all acids and acidulous salts must be considered as incompatible
with it. If equal parts of quick-lime and powdered guaiacum be rubbed
together, and a quantity of water be poured over them, and the mixture
be allowed to stand until it becomes fine, we shall obtain a solution of
this substance, which will mix in any proportion with aqueous vehicles
without decomposition, and to which the aromatic spirit of ammonia may
be subsequently added with effect.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Toluiferæ Balsami.</span> E.D. This is only useful as an adjunct,
to impart agreeable flavour and fragrance to other remedies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above tinctures, when added to water, are instantly decomposed,
the practitioner must therefore remember that when he prescribes them in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>aqueous vehicles, it will be necessary to direct them to be triturated with
some viscid liquor, as mucilage, previous to the addition of the water, in
order to suspend the resinous precipitate.</p>

1787. <em>Elixir Paregoricum.</em><a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c015'><sup>[688]</sup></a> P.L. 1745. This preparation had undergone
both change of name and composition in the last Pharmacopœia;
its old name was thought improper from its similarity to that of <em>tincture of
opium</em>, and the <em>oil of aniseed</em> has been omitted on account of its disagreeable
flavour; still, however, these perpetual changes are most distressing;
the tincture, as it is now prepared, is very different from that which has
been so long and so generally sold under the name of <em>Paregoric Elixir</em>, and
the chemist is therefore obliged to keep both the preparations, and to send
the one or the other, according as it may be required by the old or new
name. One fluid-ounce contains nearly two grains of Opium and of benzoic
acid, and about one grain and a quarter of camphor. In <em>doses</em> of fʒj
to fʒiij, it is anodyne.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Cantharides.</span> D. This tincture is highly stimulating, acting
with great energy upon the urinary organs; it therefore offers a resource
in gleets, fluor albus, incontinence of urine, &amp;c. it has also proved
serviceable as a highly stimulating diuretic, in cases of <em>Hydrops Ovarii</em>.
See <em>Form. 116</em>. <em>Dose</em>, ♏︎x to fʒj, given in some demulcent infusion; it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>is likewise employed with advantage as a stimulating embrocation and rubefacient,
in conjunction with <em>soap</em> or camphor <em>liniment</em>. Externally it has
been used in the cure of Sinuses, and fistulous openings, in the proportion
of three fluid-drachms to a pint of water.<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c015'><sup>[689]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Cascarillæ.</span> L.D. It is added with much effect to different

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Catechu.</span> L.E.D. A warm and grateful astringent; very

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Cinchonæ.</span> L.E.D. Used as an adjunct to the decoction
or infusion of the bark. See <em>Form. 126, 127</em>. <em>Dose</em>, fʒj to f℥ss. It
should be preserved in a place which is not very cold; for a low temperature
precipitates the Morphia; this inconvenience, however, is obviated by
the addition of a little acetic acid, without diminishing the efficacy of the
tincture.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Cinchonæ Composita.</span> This resembles the celebrated
tincture of Huxham, and although it contains less cinchona than the simple
tincture, yet from the addition of aromatics it is more grateful and
stomachic. <em>Dose</em>, fʒj to f℥ss.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Cinnamomi.</span> L.D. See <em>Form. 101</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Cinnamomi Composita.</span> L.E.D. As this is a combination

the simple tincture. <em>Dose</em>, fʒ to fʒij.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Conii Maculati.</span> E. As <em>Conein</em> is perfectly soluble in spirit,
this tincture constitutes a very elegant and efficient form for the exhibition
of <em>Hemlock</em>; I have frequently experienced its effects, when added
to febrifuge mixtures, with satisfaction. The London college has not
hitherto admitted it into the list of tinctures, which is to be regretted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Croci.</span> E.D. It has no medicinal use, independent of its

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Gentianæ Composita.</span> L.E. An elegant stomachic bitter,
but less eligible as a remedy than the infusion. Dose, fʒi-fʒij.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Hellebori Nigri.</span> This preparation was strongly advised

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Humuli.</span> L.E. It is supposed to possess the tonic and narcotic
properties of the hop. <em>Dose</em>, fʒss to fʒiij.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Hyoscyami.</span> L. This is a much more powerful narcotic
than the preceding tincture; and it is not liable to affect the head, nor to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>produce that disturbance in the biliary secretions which so inevitably follows
the use of opium. <em>Dose</em>, fʒss to fʒij.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Jalapæ.</span> L.E. As the activity of Jalap does not reside in
any one principle, but depends upon the combination of its gum, extractive,
and resin, <em>proof</em> spirit is of course its appropriate solvent; and the resulting
tincture is therefore an active purgative, but it is rarely administered
except as an <em>adjuvant</em> to cathartic combinations. <em>Dose</em>, fʒj to f℥ss.
See <em>Form. 70, 76</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Kino.</span> L.E.D. This is little else than a solution of <em>Tannin</em>;
it is however less astringent than the tincture of Catechu. <em>Dose</em>, fʒi to

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Opii.</span> L.E.D. This is at once a most convenient and elegant

156, 172</em>. As an external application, when rubbed upon the skin it produces
anodyne effects, and it is said that these effects are very much increased
by combining it with acetic acid; an <em>acetate of morphia</em> is probably
thus produced.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Quassiæ Excelsæ.</span> E.D. The bitter principle of this root,

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tinctura Rhei Composita.</span> L. A cordial, used principally as an adjunct

of this root are extremely violent and poisonous; the ancients employed
it in various obstinate cases, but they generally regarded it as their
last resource; it acts as a violent emetic and cathartic, producing bloody
stools, great anxiety, tremors, and convulsions. Etmuller says, that the
external application of the root to the abdomen, will produce vomiting;
and Schroeder observed the same phenomenon to take place in a case
where it was used as a suppository, and its juice has been applied to the
purpose of poisoning arrows; notwithstanding these effects however the
veratrum has been very safely and successfully administered in cases of
mania, epilepsy, lepra, and gout:<a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c015'><sup>[696]</sup></a> but the most ordinary use of white hellebore

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The term wine is more strictly and especially applied to express the fermented
juice of the <em>Grape</em>, although it is generally used to denote that of
<em>any</em> sub-acid fruit. The presence of <em>Tartar</em> is perhaps the circumstance
by which the grape is most strongly distinguished from all the other sub-acid
fruits that have been applied to the purpose of wine making. The
juice of the grape, moreover, contains within itself all the principles essential
to vinification, in such a proportion and state of balance as to enable it
at once to undergo a regular and complete fermentation, whereas the juices
of other fruits require artificial additions for this purpose; and the scientific
application and due adjustment of these means, constitute the art of
making wines.<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c015'><sup>[698]</sup></a> It has been remarked, that all those wines that contain
an excess of malic acid are of a bad quality, hence the grand defect that is
necessarily inherent in the wines of this country, and which leads them to
partake of the properties of cider, for in the place of the <em>tartaric</em>, the <em>malic
acid</em> always predominates in native fruits.</p>

<p class='c007'>The characteristic ingredient of all wines is <em>Alcohol</em>, and the quantity of
this, and the condition or state of combination in which it exists, are the
circumstances that include all the interesting and disputed points of medical
enquiry. Daily experience convinces us that the same quantity of
alcohol, applied to the stomach under the form of natural wine, and in a
state of mixture with water, will produce very different effects upon the
body, and to an extent which it is difficult to comprehend; it has, for instance,
been demonstrated that Port, Madeira, and Sherry, contain from
one-fourth to one-fifth their bulk of alcohol, so that a person who takes a
bottle of either of them, will thus take nearly half a pint of alcohol, or almost
a pint of pure brandy! and moreover that different wines, although
of the same specific gravity, and consequently containing the same absolute
proportion of the spirit, will be found to vary very considerably in their
intoxicating powers; no wonder then that such results should stagger the
philosopher, who is naturally unwilling to accept any tests of difference
from the nervous system, which elude the ordinary resources of analytical
chemistry; the conclusion was therefore drawn, that alcohol must necessarily
exist in wine in a far different condition from that in which we know
it in a separate state, or in other words, that its elements only could exist
in the vinous liquor, and that their union was determined, and consequently
alcohol produced, by the action of distillation. That it was the <em>product</em>,
and not the <em>educt</em> of distillation, was an opinion which originated with
Rouelle, who asserted that alcohol was not completely formed, until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>temperature was raised to the point of distillation; more lately the same
doctrine was revived and promulgated by Fabbroni, in the memoirs of the
Florentine Academy. Gay Lussac has, however, silenced the clamorous
partisans of this theory, by separating the alcohol by distillation at the temperature
of 66° <em>Fah.</em> and by the aid of a <em>vacuum</em>, it has since been effected
at 56°: besides, it has been shewn that by precipitating the colouring matter
and some of the other elements of the wine by <em>sub-acetate of lead</em>, and
then saturating the clear liquor with <em>sub-carbonate of potass</em>, the alcohol
may be completely separated without any elevation of temperature; and
by this ingenious expedient Mr. Brande has been enabled to construct a
table, exhibiting the proportions of combined alcohol which exist in the several
kinds of wine: no doubt therefore can remain upon this subject, and
the fact of the difference of effect, produced by the same bulk of alcohol,
when presented to the stomach in different states of combination, adds another
striking and instructive illustration to those already enumerated in the
course of this work, of the extraordinary powers of chemical combination
in modifying the activity of substances upon the living system. In the
present instance, the alcohol is so combined with the extractive matter of
the wine, that it is probably incapable of exerting its full specific effects
upon the stomach, before it becomes altered in its properties, or, in other
words, <em>digested:</em> and this view of the subject may be fairly urged in explanation
of the reason why the intoxicating effects of the same wine are
so liable to vary in degree, in the same individual, from the peculiar state
of his digestive organs at the time of its potation.<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c015'><sup>[699]</sup></a> Hitherto we have only
spoken of <em>pure</em> wine, but it is essential to state that the stronger wines of
Spain, Portugal, and Sicily, are rendered remarkable in this country by the
addition of <em>Brandy</em>, and must consequently contain <em>uncombined</em> alcohol, the
proportion of which however will not necessarily bear a ratio to the quantity
added, because, at the period of its admixture, a renewed fermentation
is produced by the scientific vintner, which will assimilate and combine a
certain portion of the foreign spirit with the wine: this manipulation, in
technical language, is called <em>fretting-in</em>. The free alcohol may, according
to the experiments of Fabbroni, be immediately separated by saturating
the vinous fluid with <em>sub-carbonate of potass</em>, while the combined portion
will remain undisturbed: in ascertaining the fabrication and salubrity of a
wine, this circumstance ought always to constitute a leading feature in the
inquiry; and the tables of Mr. Brande would have been greatly enhanced
in practical value, had the relative proportions of <em>uncombined</em> spirit been appreciated
in his experiments, since it is to <em>this</em>, and not to the <em>combined</em> alcohol,
that the injurious effects of the wine are to be attributed. “It is
well known,” observes Dr. Macculloch, “that diseases of the liver are the
most common, and the most formidable of those produced by the use of
<em>ardent</em> spirits; it is equally certain that no such disorders follow the intemperate
use of <em>pure</em> wine, however long indulged in: to the concealed and
unwitting consumption of spirit, therefore, as contained in the wines commonly
drunk in this country, is to be attributed the excessive prevalence of
those hepatic affections which are comparatively little known to our continental
neighbours.” Thus much is certain, that our ordinary wines contain
no alcohol, but what is disarmed of its virulence by the prophylactic
energies of combination.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>The odour, or <em>bouquet</em>, and flavour which distinguish one wine from another,
evidently depend upon some volatile and fugacious principle, soluble
in alcohol; this in sweet and half fermented wines, is immediately derived
from the fruit, as in those from the <em>Frontignan</em> and <em>Muscat</em> grapes; but in
the more perfect wines, as in <em>Claret</em>, <em>Hermitage</em>, <em>Rivesaltes</em>, and <em>Burgundy</em>,
it bears no resemblance to the natural flavour of the fruit, but is altogether
the product of the vinous process; and in some wines it arises from the introduction
of flavouring ingredients, as from almonds in Madeira wines,
as well as in those of Xeres and Saint Lucar, and hence their well known
nutty flavour. Among the ancients it was formerly, and in modern
Greece it is to this day, the fashion to give a resinous flavour, by the introduction
of Turpentine into the casks.<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c015'><sup>[700]</sup></a> These wines are supposed to assist
digestion, to restrain ulcerous, and other morbid discharges, to provoke
urine, and to strengthen the bowels; but Dioscorides also informs us that
they were known to produce vertigo, pain in the head, and many evils not
incidental to the same quantity of vinous liquor when free from such admixtures.<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c015'><sup>[701]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Wines admit of being arranged into four classes.<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c015'><sup>[702]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>1. <span class='sc'>Sweet Wines</span>; which contain the greatest proportion of extractive
and saccharine matter, and generally the least ardent spirit, though this is
often rather disguised than absent; as in these wines a proportion of sugar
has remained unchanged during the process of vinification, they must be
considered as the results of an imperfect fermentation, and are in fact mixtures
of wine and sugar; accordingly, whatever arrests the progress of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>fermentation, must have a tendency to produce a sweet wine; thus boiling
the <em>must</em> or drying the fruit will, by partially separating the natural leaven
and dissipating the water, occasion such a result as is exemplified by the
manufacture of the wines of Cyprus, the <em>vino cotto</em> of the Italians and the
<em>vinum coctum</em> of the ancients, by that of <em>Frontignac</em>, the rich and luscious
wines of <em>Canary</em>, the celebrated <em>Tokay</em>, <em>Vino Tinto</em> (Tent of Hungary) the
Italian <em>Montefiascone</em>, the Persian <em>Schiras</em>, the <em>Malmsey wines of Candia</em>,
<em>Chio</em>, <em>Lesbos</em>, and <em>Tenedos</em>, and those of the other islands of the Archipelago.
The wines of the ancients, as Chaptal observes, were so concentrated
by boiling, that they rather deserve the name of extracts or syrups, than
that of wines; they, must have been very sweet, and but little fermented;
apparently to remedy this, they were kept for a great length of time; according
to Aristotle and Galen, seven years was the shortest period necessary
for keeping wine before it was fit to drink, but wines of a century
old were not uncommon at the tables of the luxurious citizens of ancient
Rome, and Horace boasts of his drinking <em>Falernian</em>, born as it were with
him, or which reckoned its age from the same consuls.<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c015'><sup>[703]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>2. <span class='sc'>Sparkling or Effervescing Wines</span>, as Champagne, are indebted
for their characteristic properties to the presence of carbonic acid; they rapidly
intoxicate, in consequence of the alcohol, which is suspended in, or
combined with the gas, being thus applied in a sudden and very divided
state to a large extent of nervous surface; for the same reason, their effects
are as transitory as they are sudden.<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c015'><sup>[704]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>3. <span class='sc'>Dry and Light.</span> These are exemplified by the more esteemed
German wines, as <em>Hock</em>, <em>Rhenish</em>, <em>Mayne</em>, <em>Moselle</em>, <em>Necker</em>, and <em>Elsass</em>, and
those highly flavoured wines, <em>Burgundy</em>, <em>Claret</em>, <em>Hermitage</em>, &amp;c. They
contain a very inconsiderable degree of ardent spirit, and combine with it
the effect of an acid.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <span class='sc'>Dry and Strong</span>, as <em>Madeira</em>, <em>Port</em>, <em>Sherry</em>, &amp;c. The name <em>Sec</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>corruptly written Sack, signifies dry; the <em>Sec</em> wine prepared at Xeres<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c015'><sup>[705]</sup></a> in
Spain, is called according to our orthography, <em>Sherris</em>, or <em>Sherry</em>. In the
manufacture of Sherry, <em>Lime</em><a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c015'><sup>[706]</sup></a> is added to the grapes, a circumstance, observes
Dr. Macculloch, apparently conducive to its well known dry quality,
and which probably acts by neutralizing a portion of <em>malic</em> or <em>tartaric</em> acid.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the adulteration and medication of wines, three principal objects are
attempted, viz. 1. <em>To give them strength</em>, which is effected by adding any
ardent spirit; but the wine is slowly decomposed by it. 2. <em>To perfect or
change their colour.</em> It is very usual to change <em>white</em> wines, when they
have grown brown or rough, into <em>red</em> wines, by means of sloes, or
other colouring matter. 3. <em>To lessen, or remove their acidity.</em> It is
well known that lead in different forms has frequently been employed
for this purpose; the practice, however, is attended with most dangerous
consequences; but which Dr. Macculloch is inclined to believe has been
over-rated, since the compounds which this metal forms with the tartaric
and malic acids are insoluble; but against this argument, the decisive
results of experience may be opposed, and Fourcroy conceived that by the
addition of Vinegar, a soluble triple salt, an <em>aceto-tartrate</em> of lead, was produced.
The fraud may be easily detected by the test<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c015'><sup>[707]</sup></a> invented by Dr.
Hahnemann. The ancients, it appears, were acquainted with this property
in lead, for according to Pliny, the Greeks and Romans improved the
quality of their wines by immersing a plate of lead in them.<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c015'><sup>[708]</sup></a> Wine, as a
pharmaceutical agent, has been employed to extract several of the principles
of vegetables, and to dissolve certain mineral bodies: as a solvent,
however, it is liable to many serious objections, as inequality of strength,
and uncertainty of composition; thus sound and perfectly fermented dry
wine, as <em>Sherry</em>, is frequently unable to dissolve iron, while tartarized antimony
is instantly decomposed by every other. As a menstruum, to obtain
an extract, it is quite inadmissible on account of the residuum which it
leaves by evaporation. From such considerations the London College
have at length substituted a weak spirit, for the wine formerly employed,
although the term “<em>Vinum</em>” is still retained in the Pharmacopœia, to obviate
those embarrassments which must ever attend a change of name, with
a corresponding change of properties. The Committee were fully prepared
to expect the captious objections which are urged against this measure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>but as the name is <em>chemically</em> and <em>medicinally</em> correct, the etymologist may
be fairly allowed to enjoy his assumed triumph without molestation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Vinum Aloes.</span> L.E.D. This solution contains all the virtues of the
Aloes, and is more agreeable than the tincture. It is a warm stomachic
in doses of fʒj to fʒij, and a stimulating purgative when given from f℥j
to f℥ij.</p>

<p class='c007'>By referring to the Pharmacopœia, it will be perceived that alcoholic
menstrua of different strengths, have been employed for the different preparations.
The proportions were deduced from careful experiments, and are
adapted to the composition of the substances which the spirit is intended
to dissolve: <em>e. g.</em></p>

    <div>VINUM ANTIMONII TARTARIZATI. L.</div>
    <div class='c004'><span class='sc'>Liquor Antimonii Tartarizati</span>. P.L. 1809.</div>
    <div class='c004'><em>Antimonial Wine.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>During the period that I was Censor of the College, I took considerable
trouble, in conjunction with my colleagues, to ascertain the state in which
this preparation was to be generally met with in the wholesale and retail
shops of the metropolis. We were satisfied, during our official visitations,
that where <em>sound</em> Sherry wine had been employed as a solvent, an efficient
and permanent solution was obtained, and that no precipitation of Antimony
took place, the sediment which occurred being merely <em>Tartrate of Lime</em>,
an incidental impurity derived from the <em>Cream of tartar:</em> but in a majority
of instances an inferior wine of British manufacture was substituted, in
which case the Antimonial Oxyd was universally found in a copious precipitate,
in combination with vegetable extractive matter; and I have even
seen this decomposition so complete, that the supernatant liquor would not
yield any trace of the antimonial salt. This report has been confirmed by
successive Censors, and the College have accordingly endeavoured to remedy
the evil, by superseding the use of wine altogether, and of introducing
a spirit of equivalent strength. The virtues of this solution are those detailed
under the history of <em>Antimonium Tartarizatum</em>; of which two grains
are contained in every fluid-ounce of the preparation. The Medicinal
Dynameter will shew the proportion of salt in any other given quantity.
<span class='sc'>Dose</span>, ♏︎x to fʒj, in any suitable vehicle, repeated every three or four hours,
in which case it acts as a diaphoretic. As an emetic, it may be given to
infants in the dose of a tea-spoonful, every ten minutes, until the desired
effect is produced. See <em>Form: 69</em>, and 117.<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c015'><sup>[710]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Vinum Colchici.</span> This medicated wine is made as follows: Take of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>the recent bulb of the Colchicum, sliced and bruised, [pound]j; of Proof Spirit,
f℥iv; of water, f℥viij; let them infuse for fourteen days, and filter for use.
There is perhaps no form better calculated to ensure the medical effects
of the plant than the one we are now considering. Its dose may be stated
to be from ♏︎xx to fʒiss. The virtues of Colchicum have been already
noticed, see <em>Colchici Radix</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Vinum Ferri.</span> L.D. When prepared according to the London College
(P.L. 1809.) each pint is stated to contain 22 grains of the red Oxide of
Iron; the strength however must in such a case depend upon the quantity
of <em>tartar</em> contained in the wine. Very dry Sherry is frequently incapable
of acting upon the iron until a small proportion of Cream of Tartar be
added to it; would it not therefore be adviseable to direct at once a given
portion of <em>ferrum tartarizatum</em> to be dissolved in wine? The Dublin formula
is more eligible than that of the former London Pharmacopœia, since it
directs the use of <em>Rhenish</em> wine instead of Sherry as a solvent, and iron
wire in preference to iron <em>filings</em>; this last circumstance is important, for
the purest iron can only be drawn, and this is most easily acted upon by
the super-tartrate of potass. These observations are offered to those who
still prefer to make the preparation with wine. They can have no relation
to the present <em>Vinum Ferri</em> of the London College, which is prepared
with a weak spirit, and which contains tartrate of potass and iron, with an
excess of super-tartrate which supplies the place of the acid contained in
the wine, and ensures the solution of the tartarized iron in the Spirit. According
to the experiments of Mr. Phillips, which I have every reason to
believe accurate, the present preparation contains less peroxide of iron than
the former did; it will be seen by the Dynameter that f℥j contains exactly
one grain, which is exactly equivalent to five grains of Tartarized Iron,
whereas an equal quantity of the former wine held in solution 1–4/10 gr,
which was equivalent to seven grains of the salt. <em>Med. Uses.</em> It is the
least unpleasant of all the preparations of iron, and its medicinal activity
is supported by the testimony of ages, for it is one of the oldest preparations
with which we are acquainted. <em>Dose</em>, fʒij to f℥ss.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Vinum Ipecacuanhæ.</span> L.E.D. The virtues of this root are completely
extracted by dilute spirit. <em>Dose</em>, as an emetic, from fʒij to f℥ss: as a
diaphoretic, from ♏︎xx to xl. <em>See Form. 63, 137.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Vinum Opii.</span> L.E.<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c015'><sup>[711]</sup></a> This is a spirituous solution of the <em>extract</em> of
Opium combined with various aromatics, which are supposed to modify
the effects of the opium, while by the substitution of the extract for the
crude opium, it is considered as being less likely to disturb the nervous
system. I submit whether the views offered under the history of Wine,
respecting the relative effects of combined and uncombined Alcohol, might
not lead us, by analogy, to prepare a more efficient <em>vinum opii</em>, and a preparation
less likely to affect the stomach: by adding the opium to the
wine during its state of fermentation, it would enter into intimate union
with its elements, in the same way that brandy is incorporated by the
technical manipulation of <em>fretting-in:</em> this suggestion is also sanctioned by
the generally acknowledged superiority of the <em>Black Drop</em>, which I have
little doubt is indebted for its peculiar efficacy to the state of combination
in which the <em>acetate of morphia</em> exists in the vinous menstruum. The preparation,
when made with wine, as directed in the late Pharmacopœia, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>nearly analogous to the celebrated <em>Liquid Laudanum</em><a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c015'><sup>[712]</sup></a> of Sydenham, and
its degree of narcotic power is nearly the same as that of the ordinary
tincture, as may be seen by referring to the <em>Medicinal Dynameter</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Vinum Veratri.</span> L. Since the discovery of the real nature of the
<em>Eau Medicinale</em>, this preparation has fallen into comparative disuse, and
might have been removed, as we have now introduced the <em>Vinum Colchici</em>.
It is however a singular circumstance that both these preparations
should owe their medicinal powers to the same elementary principle, viz.
<em>Veratria</em>; and as some practitioners are still addicted to its use, the Committee
agreed to let it remain.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These are unctuous substances analogous to <em>Cerates</em> except in consistence,
which is much less firm, and scarcely exceeds that of butter: formerly,
ointments were numerous and complicated in their composition, and
surgeons adapted with much technical formality different ointments to
answer different indications: this practice however has undergone a very
judicious reform, and it is now well understood that <em>in general</em> all that is
required in an ointment is a suitable tenacity and consistence, to keep the
parts to which it may be applied soft and easy, and at the same time to
exclude from them the atmospheric air; in some cases, however, these
simple compositions are made the <em>vehicles</em> of more active remedies, as in
the following preparations, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Unguentum Cantharidis.</span> L. As the active ingredient in this ointment
is derived from an infusion of the Cantharides, it is extremely mild,
and frequently inefficacious. The <em>ceratum cantharidis</em> furnishes a more
certain application.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Unguentum Elemi Compositum.</span> L. The elemi and turpentine in
this ointment, render it stimulant and digestive.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Unguentum Hydrargyri Fortius.</span> L. The precise nature<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c015'><sup>[713]</sup></a> of this
compound does not appear to have been known until the late researches<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c015'><sup>[714]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>of Mr. Donovan, (<em>Annals of Philosophy</em>, <em>November, 1819</em>,) which promise
to lead to a more uniform, efficacious, and economical mode of preparing
it; for they<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c015'><sup>[715]</sup></a> shew that in the officinal ointment, the mercury exists in two
different conditions,—in the state of metal, <em>mechanically mixed</em>, as asserted
by Vogel, and in that of an oxide, <em>chemically combined</em> with the lard, and
that the medicinal activity of the ointment exclusively resides in this latter
portion, the presence of metallic mercury not only being useless but injurious,
by obstructing the absorption of the active compound of the oxide.
Mr. Donovan accordingly formed a direct chemical combination, by continually
agitating together lard and black oxide of mercury at the temperature
of 350° <em>Fah:</em> for two hours. At the end of the process it appeared
that every ounce of lard had dissolved, and combined with 21 grains of
oxide; and from the trials which have been made respecting its activity,
it would seem to be as efficient as the officinal ointment, and moreover that
it may be introduced by inunction in one third of the time. The investigation
is highly important, for it not only offers the means of preparing a
mercurial ointment more œconomically, but one more active and manageable,
and less liable to that want of uniformity in strength, which must always
attend a preparation in which so much labour is required for its completion;
for independent of that variation in strength which will arise from
imperfect triture, it is by no means an uncommon practice to use chemical
means, which are not admissible, to facilitate the process, such as the addition
of <em>Sulphur</em>, which is found to abridge very considerably the labour
requisite for the extinction of the mercury, but it converts a portion of the
metal into a <em>Sulphuret</em>, and diminishes the power of the unguent. There
is however a method of facilitating the process, which is not liable to any
apparent objection, but the theory of its operation is obscure; it consists in

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>Mercurial ointment furnishes the most prompt, and least exceptionable
mode of impregnating the system. The external method of administering
mercury, says Mr. John Hunter, is always preferable to the internal, because
the skin is not nearly so essential to life as the stomach, and therefore
is capable in itself of bearing much more than the stomach. The inunction
is generally performed by rubbing ʒss to ʒj on some part of the
body where the cuticle is thin, generally on the inside of the thigh, except
perhaps in cases of chronic hepatitis, when it is more usually applied to
the region of the liver, care being taken that the friction is continued until
every particle of the ointment disappears; and for obvious reasons, the operation
ought if practicable to be performed by the patient himself. Where
it has been an object to saturate the system with mercury as quickly as
possible, I have witnessed the advantage of confining, by means of slips of
bladder, a drachm of mercurial ointment in each axilla, in addition to the
mercurial friction. Camphor, turpentine, and other stimulants, have been
sometimes added to the ointment, with a view of promoting its absorption;
this however is an erroneous practice, since these acrid ingredients soon
produce pustules on the skin, which prevent the continuance of the friction;
the warm bath is a more certain, and less objectionable <em>adjuvant</em>,
many practitioners therefore advise the body to be immersed in a warm
bath, once and again, before the course is commenced, and to repeat it
once or twice a week during its continuance: the length of time to be employed
in a course of mercury, and the quantity to be given, are circumstances
that must in every case be left to the discretion of the practitioner.
Mercury, when introduced into the body, acts as a powerful
stimulant, and pervades every part of the system; hence it is the most
powerful evacuant belonging to the Materia Medica; from its stimulant
operation, exerted directly or indirectly, we are able to explain its utility in
the cure of disease, and it may be made to act according to management
and circumstances, as a tonic, antispasmodic, diuretic, cathartic, sialogogue,
emmenagogue, or alterative; but its most important operation is that
displayed in removing the diseases induced by the syphilitic poison, although
its <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> is still buried amongst the many other arcana
of physic. The mode of directing and controlling the influence of mercury
in the cure of the venereal disease, is now very generally understood,
and it is to be hoped that a full confidence in its antisyphilitic powers is as
universally maintained, in spite of the late opinions which tended to depreciate
its value and to question its necessity; there is however no advantage
to be gained, as was once imagined, by exciting profuse salivation.
On its next important application, that of curing chronic affections of the
liver and dropsy, a remark which has been suggested to me by the results
of practice, may not be unacceptable. I think I have generally observed,
that when the remedy has been pushed to such an extent as to excite the
salivary glands to excessive secretion, the urinary organs cease to participate
in its stimulating action, and <em>vice versa</em>, for the mouth is rarely affected
when the mercury runs off by the kidneys; this may suggest a precaution
of some practical moment in the treatment of dropsy, and it will be
generally judicious to accompany the administration of this metal with
certain diuretics, in order to direct its operation to the kidneys;<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c015'><sup>[716]</sup></a> and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>would seem, that for such an object those diuretic medicines should be
preferred that act <em>primarily</em> on the organs, as alkalies and their combinations,
squill, &amp;c. the success of such a plan of treatment will also depend
greatly upon the exact period at which these remedies are administered;
it will for instance be right to wait until the system is, to a certain degree,
under mercurial influence. It is hardly necessary to observe, that if the
mercury runs off by the bowels, we shall be deprived of all, or of a great
share of, the benefit to be expected. In certain cases, the lymphatic vessels
seem to resist the admittance of mercury, and to refuse the conveyance
of it to the general circulation: I have already thrown out some vague
hints upon the subject, at page 156, and I must refer the reader to some
farther remarks, which I apprehend bear upon this question under the following
article.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unguentum Oxidi Hydrargyri Cinerei.</span></span> E. This consists of a
mixture of <em>one part</em> of grey oxide of mercury, and <em>three parts</em> of axunge: it
was reasonable to suppose, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</span></i>, that, as the whole of the mercury in
this ointment is oxidized, its adoption would supersede the necessity of the
labour required for the preparation of the common mercurial ointment, and
at the same time afford a combination of equal if not superior efficacy;
but experience has not justified the conclusion, for it has been found to
possess little or no activity; the consideration of it is therefore introduced
into this work, not on account of its utility, but as an object upon which
I may pause with advantage, to offer those observations which its history
is so well calculated to call forth and illustrate. The circumstance which
renders this preparation inert, will now receive a satisfactory explanation
from the experiments of Mr. Donovan, as related in the preceding article;
in short, it is a <em>mechanical mixture</em> instead of a <em>chemical combination</em>; and I
beg again to urge the importance of this distinction, and to offer the present
example as a farther illustration of the views I have already submitted
upon the subject. By subjecting this ointment for some hours to a
heat of 300°, it would without doubt become an active preparation. It is
probable that the lymphatics offers less resistance to the ingress of a mineral
body into the system when it is presented to them in combination with
some animal substance, which must alone be regarded as their peculiar
stimulus, and the only matter which they are destined perpetually to receive
and convey; for the same physiological reason, the lacteals may
probably take up iron with greater readiness when in combination with
vegetable matter, than when introduced into the stomach in a more purely
mineral form.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Unguentum Hydrargyri Mitius.</span> L. This weaker preparation is
sometimes preferred, as it irritates the skin less; it is however principally
used as a topical dressing to venereal sores, and as an application to kill
vermin on the body.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Unguentum Hydrargyri Nitratis.</span> L.E.D. vulgo <em>Citrine Ointment</em>.
It is stimulant, detergent, and alterative; when diluted with an equal
quantity of simple ointment or almond oil, it may be almost regarded as
a specific in ophthalmia tarsi, smeared upon the cilia every night at bedtime.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span><span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unguentum Hydrargyri Nitrico-oxydi.</span></span> L. An excellent stimulant
application, well adapted for giving energy to indolent ulcers. If
mixed with any ointment containing resin, it loses its red colour, passing
through olive green to black, which depends upon the conversion of the
<em>red</em> into the <em>black</em> oxide of mercury.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unguentum Hydrargyri Præcipitati Albi.</span></span> L. Stimulant and detergent.
It is said to be very efficacious in certain inveterate forms of the
Itch. With the addition of Carbonate of Potass, it has been much extolled
in various cutaneous affections.<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c015'><sup>[717]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Unguentum Picis Liquidæ.</span> L.E.D. <em>Tar Ointment.</em> This ointment
has been much extolled for the removal of tetter, and for the cure of tinea
capitis.</p>

Digestive stimulant.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Unguentum Sambuci.</span> L.D. It possesses no advantage over the simple
ointment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Unguentum Sulphuris.</span> L.E.D. This ointment is a mechanical
mixture of Lard and Sulphur, although it would appear that a small proportion
of the latter exists also in a state of chemical combination. <span class='sc'>Med.
Uses.</span> A specific in the itch. Dr. Bateman proposes a combination,
equally efficacious, but which has not the same disagreeable smell; <em>viz</em>.
“Take of sub-carbonate of potass, <em>half an ounce</em>; rose water, <em>one ounce</em>; red
sulphuret of mercury, <em>one drachm</em>; essential oil of Bergamot, half a <em>fluid-drachm</em>;
sublimed sulphur, hog’s lard, of each <em>eleven ounces</em>. Mix them.”
Jasser’s Ointment also, as altered in the Prussian Pharmacopœia, is an excellent
application in Psora, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> ℞.<em>Sulphur: Sublim:</em> ℥ij, <em>Zinci Sulphat:</em>
℥ij, <em>Ol:</em> <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lauri, et Axung. q, s, ut fiat Unguentum</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Unguentum Sulphuris Compositum.</span> L. More stimulating than
the simple ointment, from the addition of white hellebore; it is however
frequently found to excite too much irritation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Unguentum Veratri.</span> L.D. It is used for the cure of scabies, but is
less certain than the ointment of sulphur.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Unguentum Zinci.</span> L.E.D. Astringent and stimulant; very beneficial
in some species of ophthalmia, smeared upon the tarsi, every night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very efficient preparations may be also constructed by adding together
equal weights of lard and narcotic vegetable powders, as those of <em>Conium</em>,
<em>Digitalis</em>, <em>Belladonna</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>The addition of a small quantity of powdered white sugar will frequently
prevent ointments becoming rancid.</p>

operates directly, and offers therefore a prompt resource in cases of poison,
or where an immediate discharge from the stomach is required; it appears
to differ from most remedies of this nature, in not proving diaphoretic in
smaller doses: in spasmodic<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c015'><sup>[720]</sup></a> coughs it is administered with the best effects,
especially when combined with camphor or myrrh, (<em>Form. 59:</em>) in
affections of the chest attended with inordinate secretion, I have witnessed
much benefit from its exhibition, particularly when presented in the form
of lozenge; and, when dissolved in water, in the proportion of grs. ij to
f℥j, it forms a useful injection in fluor albus, &amp;c.; in small doses its internal
exhibition is also useful in Leucorrhæa. When combined with opium
it is well calculated to obviate that atony, and those frequent discharges of
fæces, without pain, that take place in the protracted stages of dysentery.
As an external application it is very generally employed in the proportion of
grs. x to eight fluid-ounces of water. The supposed ill effects consequent
on the application of preparations of lead to a great surface, have determined
some practitioners to substitute in their place, solutions of sulphate of
zinc, but not with the same effect; for to that very property, which may
occasionally render saturnine lotions dangerous, is their virtue to be attributed;

<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The College of Physicians may now be said to possess one of the most complete
collections of Materia Medica in Europe. That collected by Dr. Burgess,
and presented to the College after his death by Mr. Brande, to whom it was bequeathed,
has lately been collated with the cabinet of Dr. Coombe, purchased for
that purpose. Its arrangement has been directed by a feeling of convenience for
reference, rather than by any theoretical views relative to the natural, chemical,
and medicinal histories of its constituent parts. Under proper regulations, it is accessible
to the studious and respectable members of the profession.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. A late foreign writer impressed with this sentiment has given the following flattering
definition of our profession. ‘Physic is the art of amusing the patient, while
Nature cures the disease.’ This is a sarcasm which can only be equalled by the
churlish and ill-humoured apostrophe of our own Dr. Samuel Johnson, who, in
speaking of the profession of physic, exclaims ‘It is a melancholy attendance on
misery; a mean submission to peevishness; and a continual interruption of pleasure.’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Observation, says professor Leslie, is the close inspection and attentive examination
of those phenomena which arise in the course of Nature; Experiment, as
the term implies, consists in a kind of trial, or artificial selection and combination
of circumstances, for the purpose of searching after the remote results.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. The refractive power of an inflammable body bears also a proportion to its perfection,
whence it may be sometimes used as a test of its purity; thus Dr. Wollaston
found that genuine Oil of Cloves had a refractive power of 1.535, while that of an
inferior quality did not exceed 1.498.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. Elizabeth Woodcock, who was buried in the snow for the space of eight days,
in the neighbourhood of Cambridge, and whom I frequently visited, died in consequence
of the stimulants which she could not resist, and which in her peculiar state
of excitement she was unable to bear. In the first volume of the Memoirs of the
Philosophical Society of Manchester, a case of a Miner is recorded, who after remaining
for eight days without food, was killed by being placed in a warm bed, and
fed with chicken-broth.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. The words ‘Incantation,’ and ‘Charm,’ appear to have been derived from the
ancient practice of curing diseases by Poetry and Music. (Carmen) Thus Cœlius
Aurelianus, decantare loca Dolentia. Democritus says that many diseases are capable
of being cured by the sound of a flute, when properly played. Marianus
Capellus assures us, that fevers may be cured by appropriate songs; Asclepiades actually
employed the trumpet, for the relief of Sciatica, and tells us that it is to be
continued until the fibres of the part begin to palpitate, when the pain will vanish.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. similar superstition is still practised by the Indians. There is a species of

the Cholic by being applied to the navel.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. As these persons were ambitious to pass for the descendants of Esculapius, they
assumed the name of The <span class='sc'>Asclepiades</span>. The writings of Pausanius, Philostratus,
and Plutarch, abound with the artifices of those early physicians. Aristophanes
describes in a truly comic manner the craft and pious avarice of these godly men,
and mentions the dexterity and promptitude with which they collected, and put
into their bags, the offerings on the altar. The patients, during this period, reposed
on the skins of sacrificed rams, in order that they might procure celestial visions.
As soon as they were believed to be asleep, a priest, clothed in the dress of Esculapius,
imitating his manners, and accompanied by the daughters of the god, that
is, by young actresses, thoroughly instructed in their parts, entered, and delivered
a medical opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. The Plague of London was supposed to have arisen from such a cause, as we
learn from the writers of that period. I shall quote a passage from a pamphlet by
W. Kemp, M. A. dedicated to Charles the Second. ‘One cause of breeding the
pestilence is that corruption of the air, which is occasioned by the influence of the
Stars, by the aspects, conjunctions, and oppositions of the Planets, by the eclipses
of the Sun and Moon, and by the consequences of Comets.’ ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Astra regunt homines,
sed regit astra Deus.</span>’ Hippocrates advises his son Thessalus to study numbers
and geometry, (‘Epist. ad Thessalum.’) because, says he, the rising and setting of
the Stars have a great effect upon Distempers. Citois, the historian of the celebrated
Colic of Poitou (Colica Pictonum), which raged with such epidemic fury in that
province during the Sixteenth century, drops a hint, apparently with a view to account
for the origin of the disease, viz. that to the great astonishment of Astrologers,
‘a new Star had, in the same year made its appearance in the constellation
of Cassiopeia’.—(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diatriba de novo et populari, apud Pictones, dolore colico
bilioso.</span>)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. The precious stones were, at first, only used as Amulets, or external charms,
but like many other articles of the Materia Medica, they passed, by a mistake
in the mode of their application, from the outside to the inside of the body,
and they were accordingly powdered and administered as specifics. An analogous
case of the perverted administration of a popular remedy is afforded in the history
of the Tench; which Sennertus describes as a remedy capable of curing the Jaundice,
which he allows is effected ‘by secret attraction, and the power of Amulets.’
In the course of time, it became a reputed food in the cure of that disease, and
Tench broth was prescribed upon all such occasions.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. Mystery is the very soul of Empiricism; withdraw the veil, and the confidence
of the patient instantly languishes; thus Pliny, ‘Minus credunt quæ ad suam salutem
pertinent, si intelligunt.’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. It was this historian who said, that Medicine was invented by Apollo, improved
by Esculapius, and brought to perfection by the physician of Cos.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. Paracelsus exclaims, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stellas terrenes esse Plantas, quæ celestes plantas, i. e.
Stellas, respiciant, ita ut quævis planta suam habeat stellam specificam.</span>’</p>

<p class='c007'>The Druids of Gaul and Britain, who were both priests and physicians, gathered
and cut the <em>Missletoe</em> with a golden knife, only when the Moon was six days old,
and being afterwards consecrated by certain forms, it was considered as an antidote
to poisons, and a preventive of sterility. Plinii. Lib. xvi, c. 44.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Vervain</em>, (Verbena Officinalis,) after libations of honey, was to be gathered
at the rising of the dog-star, when neither sun nor moon shone, with the left hand
only; when thus prepared, it was said to vanquish fevers, and other distempers,
was an antidote to the bite of serpents, and a charm to conciliate friendship. Plin.
Lib. xxv. c. 9. I shall however hereafter shew that the medicinal reputation of this
herb derived its origin from a source more ancient even than that of Druidism.
Magnenus (Exercitat. de Tabaco,) has given us the following precept,—‘Tabacum
seratur luna <em>crescente</em>, colligatur autem <em>decrescente</em> luna.’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. In later times these heathen symbols were dropped, and others were adopted
to propitiate the favour and assistance of heaven; for this purpose the Alchemists
stamped the figure of the cross upon the vessel in which they were to obtain their
long sought for prize; a superstitious practice, from which the term <em>crucible</em> derived
its origin. I am well aware that another explanation has been given, and that the
word has been derived from <em>Crucio</em>, since in the language of the Alchemists, the
crucible was the vessel in which the metals were <em>tortured</em> to force them to assume
the form of gold.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f25'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. Mr. Boyle was pre-eminently credulous with respect to <em>specifics</em>, and contributed
very greatly to the encouragement and diffusion of empiricism, by publishing
many prescriptions as affording infallible remedies, which were communicated to
him by a variety of persons, who either from ignorance or design vouched for their
efficacy.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. The Soothsayers attributed many mystic properties to the Coral, and it was
believed to be capable of giving protection against the influence of ‘<em>Evil Eyes</em>;’ it
was even supposed that Coral would drive away Devils and Evil Spirits; hence
arose the custom of wearing amulets composed of it, around the neck, and of making
crowns of it. Pliny and Dioscorides are very loud in their praises of the medicinal
properties of this substance, and Paracelsus says that it should be worn
around the necks of infants as an admirable preservative against fits, sorcery, charms,
and even against poison. It is a curious circumstance, that the same superstitious
belief should exist among the Negroes of the West Indies, who affirm that the colour
of Coral is always affected by the state of health of the wearer, it becoming paler
in disease. In Sicily it is also commonly worn as an amulet.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. See “Sir Kenelm Digby’s Discourse upon the Cure by Sympathy, pronounced
at Montpellier, before an assembly of Nobles and learned men. Translated into
English, by R. White, Gentleman, and published in 1658.” King James the First
obtained from Sir Kenelm the discovery of his secret, which he pretended had
been taught him by a Carmelite Friar, who had learned it in America or Persia.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. At the same time it must be acknowledged that many of these revolting applications
have actually produced benefit by a physical operation; we need only mention
the nauseous remedies recommended by many writers on Midwifery to expedite
delivery, which induced the desired effect by producing nausea, or vomiting.
Hartman says (Opera. Fol. p. 72) that he has often witnessed amongst the poor,
that difficult labour has been accelerated by a draught of the husband’s urine! and,
he adds, that horse dung infused in wine is efficacious in expelling the Placenta.
Sarah Stone, a midwife who published some cases in 1737, mentions several instances
of women in labour, to whom was given the juice of leeks, mixed with their
husband’s urine, in order to strengthen the pains. Nauseous remedies have always
enjoyed the confidence of the vulgar; this prejudice would seem to be the result
of a species of false reasoning, by no means uncommon, that as every thing
medicinal is nauseous, so must every thing that is nauseous be consequently medicinal.</p>

he was alternately purged, vomited, and blistered; made to walk bare-footed, under
a burning sun in summer, and in winter he was doomed to seek for the return of
health, by bathing his feeble and emaciated body in the river. All this severity, he
was made to believe, was exercised towards him by the express directions of Esculapius
himself, with whom he was persuaded to fancy that he conversed in his
dreams, and frequently beheld in nocturnal visions. Upon one occasion, the god,
fatigued with the importunities of his votary, ordered him to lose 120 lbs. of blood;
the unhappy man not having so much in his body, <em>wisely</em> took the liberty of interpreting

subject to state, that the above observation may with as much truth and force be
applied to medical writings as to medical substances. Nothing is more fatal to the
permanent success and character of an author, than the extravagant and unmerited
encomiums of time-serving reviewers. It would be invidious to illustrate this truth
by examples, or we might adduce some striking instances where the inappropriate

<p class='c007'>Upon no principle of combination can this heterogeneous farrago be vindicated.
It has, however, enjoyed the confidence of physicians for many ages, and is therefore
entitled to some notice. It was supposed to have been invented by Mithridates,
the famous king of Pontus, the receipt for which was said to have been found
among his papers after his defeat by Pompey, at which time it was published in
Rome under the title of ‘Antidotum Mithridatum;’ but the probability is, says Dr.
Heberden, that Mithridates was as much a stranger to his own antidote as several
eminent physicians have since been to the medicines that are daily advertised under
their names. It was asserted, that whoever took a proper quantity in the morning,
was insured from poison during the whole of that day, (Galen de Antidot. Lib. 1.)
and it was further stated, that Mithridates himself was so fortified against all baneful
drugs, that none would produce any effect when he attempted to destroy himself.
(Celsus, lib. 5. c. 23.) In the course of ages it has undergone numerous alterations.
According to Celsus, who first described it, it contained only 35 simples; Andromachus,
Physician to Nero, added vipers, and increased the number of ingredients to
75; and when thus <em>reformed</em>, he called it <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γαλήνη</span>—but in Trajan’s time it obtained
the name of <em>Theriaca</em>, either from the vipers in it, or from its supposed effect in curing
the bites of venomous animals. Damocrates gave a receipt for it in Greek
Iambics, which has been preserved by Galen. It appears then that its composition
has hardly remained the same for a hundred years; it is, says Dr. Heberden,
a farrago, that has no better title to the name of Mithridates than, as it so well
resembles, the numerous undisciplined forces of a barbarous king, made up of a
dissonant crowd collected from different countries, mighty in appearance, but in
reality, an ineffective multitude, that only hinder each other. <span class='fss'>ANTIOPIAKA</span>, by W.

Jean Nicot was Ambassador at the Court of Lisbon from Francis II, and he transmitted,
or carried either the seed, or the plant to Catherine de Medicis: it was then
considered as one of the wonders of the new world, and was supposed to possess
very extraordinary virtues; this seems to be the first authentic record of the introduction
of this plant into Europe. In 1589 the Cardinal Santa Croce, returning from
his nunciature in Spain and Portugal to Italy, carried thither with him Tobacco, and
we may form some notion of the enthusiasm with which its introduction was hailed,
from a perusal of the poetry which the subject inspired; the poets compare the exploit
of the holy Cardinal with that of his progenitor who brought home the wood
of the true cross.</p>

<p class='c007'>In England, it is said that the smoking Tobacco was first introduced by Sir Walter
Raleigh on his return from America. James the First wrote a philippic against it,
entitled a “<span class='sc'>Counterblaste to Tobacco</span>,” in which the royal author, with more
prejudice than dignity, informs his loving subjects that ‘it is a custome loathsome
to the eye, hatefull to the nose, harmefull to the braine, dangerous to the lungs; and
in the blacke stinking fume thereof, neerest resembling the horrible Stigian smoake
of the pit that is bottomlesse.’ In 1604 this monarch endeavoured by means of
heavy imposts to abolish its use in this country, and in 1619 he commanded that no
planter in Virginia should cultivate more than 100 lbs. It must be confessed that
some legislative enactment was necessary at this period for restricting the custom
of smoking Tobacco; for we are told in the <em>Counterblaste</em>, that many persons expended
as much as five hundred pounds per annum in the purchase of this article,
which in those days was an enormous amount.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1624 Pope Urban the VIIIth published a decree of excommunication against
all who took snuff in the church. Ten years after this, smoking was forbidden in
Russia, under the pain of having the nose cut off; in 1653 the Council of the Canton
of Appenzel cited smokers before them, whom they punished, and they ordered
all innkeepers to inform against such as were found smoking in their houses. The police
regulations of Bern made in 1661 was divided according to the Ten Commandments,
in which the prohibition of smoking stands immediately beneath the command
against adultery; this prohibition was renewed in 1675, and the Tribunal instituted
to put it into execution—viz.; <span class='sc'>Chambre au Tabac</span>—continued to the middle
of the eighteenth century. Pope Innocent the XIIth, in 1690 excommunicated
all those who were found taking snuff or tobacco in the church of St. Peter at
Rome; even so late as 1719 the Senate of Strasburgh prohibited the cultivation of
Tobacco from an apprehension that it would diminish the growth of corn; Amurath
the IVth published an edict which made smoking Tobacco a capital offence;
this was founded on an opinion that it rendered the people infertile. Those who
are curious to learn more of the history of this extraordinary plant, I beg to refer to
a very interesting paper by ‘Medicus,’ in the 24th volume of the ‘London Medical
and Physical Journal,’ page 445.</p>

waxe with Henbane seeds, which must be lighted so that the perfume of the candell
do enter into the tooth.’ This said Dr. Andrew Boorde is too important a personage
to be passed over without some farther notice in this place, being no less than the
Founder of that dignified class of the medical fraternity, better known by the name
of <em>Merry Andrews</em>. Dr. Andrew Boorde lived in the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward
VI, and Queen Mary, and was in the constant habit of frequenting fairs and markets,
at which he harangued the populace publicly: his speeches were extremely
humourous and occasioned considerable mirth; his successors in this same line naturally

on Dioscorides, which was first printed in 1554, passed through seventeen editions,
and that 32,000 copies had been sold before the year 1561; and he tells us in this

of the Roman Empire,—Arch-dukes,—Cardinals,—Bishops,—Dukes,

colour which it undergoes from <em>black</em> to <em>white</em>, during its preparation? Another explanation
has been also given, viz. quòd <em>nigro</em> humori sit <em>bonum</em>—a <em>good</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλος</span>) remedy
for <em>black</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μελας</span>) bile. This Theory derives much support from the black appearance
of the stools, which is usually produced by the use of Calomel, and which
was erroneously attributed to the searching and efficacious nature of the purgative.
The Calomel of Riverius was a compound of <em>Hydrargyri Sub-muriat:</em> ℈j and <em>Scammoneæ</em>

or Pliny. Cæsalpinus was the father of botanical system, and he was probably
the first who suggested the idea that the virtues of plants were discoverable by
their structure and alliance to each other. In his preface to his work, “De Plantis,”
he says ‘Quæ enim generis societate junguntur, plerumque et similes possident
facultates.’ This idea was pursued by Petiver, an apothecary in the city of London,
a name well known in the annals of Botany; there is a paper by him on this
subject, in the 21st volume of the Philosophical Transactions, entitled, “Some attempts
to prove that herbs of the same make and class, for the generality, have the
like Vertue, and Tendency to work the same Effects.” Dr. Murray has adopted an
arrangement founded upon natural character in his celebrated work entitled, “Apparatus
Medicaminum”.</p>

anecdote, which to my mind elucidates the nature and extent of such fallacies more
strikingly than any example which could be adduced. Shortly after Sir Humphry
Davy had succeeded in decomposing the fixed alkalies, a portion of <em>Potassium</em> was
placed in the hands of one of our most distinguished chemists, with a query as to
its nature? the philosopher observing its aspect and splendour, did not hesitate in
pronouncing it to be metallic, and uniting at once the idea of weight with that of
metal, the evidence of his senses was even insufficient to dissever ideas so inseparably
associated in his mind, and, balancing the specimen on his fingers, he exclaimed,
“it is certainly metallic, and <em>very ponderous</em>?” Now this anecdote is not
related in disparagement to the philosopher in question. Who could have been
prepared to meet with a substance, so novel and anomalous as to overturn every
preconceived notion?—<span class='fss'>A METAL SO LIGHT AS TO SWIM UPON WATER, AND SO INFLAMMABLE

but it is more generally produced by art, by placing them in situations where there
is a green deposit from the sea, which appears to consist of the vegetating germs of
marine <em>Confervæ</em> and <em>Fuci</em>, and which impart their colour to the oysters. For this
object the Dutch formerly took oysters from beds on our coasts, and deposited them
on their own. Native oysters transported into the Colchester beds soon assume a
green colour. It is unnecessary to refute the popular error which attributed this
change of colour to the operation of copper.</p>

similar error, from mistaking figurative expressions for literal truths. A knowledge
of this species of fallacy will explain the origin of several very extraordinary receipts.
I shall select the following instance, by way of illustration. In many of
the ancient works on Physic, we find the <em>blood of the goat</em> extolled for its efficacy in
dissolving stones, and, from this supposed lithontriptic virtue, it forms the principal
ingredient of the <span class='sc'>Powder of Nicolaus</span>, and of the <span class='sc'>Electuary of the Queen of
Colein</span>. The expression which gave origin to this belief was evidently allegorical,
signifying that the blood of the goat, by which our Saviour was typified, was capable
of softening the stony hearts of his enemies, or, according to others, that by his
influence, the stony rocks, and veil of the temple were shatterd. <em>Browne’s Vulgar

a young student, who during a transient visit at that place, accidentally produced
a collection of medical receipts which he had selected from the works of the
most esteemed writers, and with which the physicians of Nuremburg were so highly
pleased that they urged him to print it for the benefit of the apothecaries, and obtained
the sanction of the Senate to the undertaking; so casual was the circumstance
to which we owe the institution of Pharmacopœias. The London College
were among the last to frame a standard Code of Medicines; most cities in Europe
having anticipated us in the performance of this task; our first Pharmacopœia was
not published until the reign of James the first, A. D. 1618, exactly a century after
the College had received their Charter from Henry. Successive editions appeared

a singular vivacity in the manner of conducting the experiments, and of keeping

<p class='c007'><a href='#r128'>128</a>. The term <em>sympathy</em> has often been objected to, as being too figurative; it is
certainly a metaphor taken from an affection of the mind, but, as Sir Gilbert Blane
very justly remarks, the import of words ought either to be assumed conventionally
according to a definition, or to be adhered to in the sense affixed to it by established
usage; “by <em>animal sympathy</em>,” says he, “is not meant the intelligible principle of
Stahl’s hypothesis, but that mutual influence of distant parts, so subtle and rapid as in
some instances to be compared to thought or lightning; while in other instances it
is an action more tardy and habitual.” <em>Medical Logic</em>, <em>Edit.</em> 2nd, p. 123. In the
present work, I wish the reader to understand the term <em>sympathy</em>, wherever it may
occur, in conformity with the above definition.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r131'>131</a>. This is probably the reason of many bodies producing but little effect upon the
inferior animals. The vegetable eaters are certainly less affected by vegetable poisons
than those animals who exclusively live upon animal substances: it is thus, that
a rabbit can take a very large dose of opium without any ill effects, while half the
same quantity would poison a dog. It is a curious fact, that a sound horse can
take a very considerable portion of opium with impunity, but if he be weakened by
previous disease, by strong purgatives, or by excessive bleeding, he is speedily destroyed
by a much less dose; (<em>See Bracy Clarke’s Reformed Pharmacopœia for Horses.</em>)
In this latter case, does it not appear that the fatal result depends upon the fact of
the digestive organs having been disabled, by debility, from effecting that decomposition
by which under ordinary circumstances, the drug is disarmed of its potency?
What important lights might not be obtained by the institution of a series
of well devised experiments upon the comparative effects of medicinal bodies upon
man and other animals? The Physiologist has thus availed himself of the resources
of the comparative anatomist, and I feel persuaded, that results equally beneficial to
science would follow a similar inquiry in relation to the operation of medicines.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r153'>153</a>. Few discoveries in physiology have thrown greater light upon this important
subject than that of M. Majendie, published in his <span class='sc'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal De Physiologie Experimentale</span></span>,
(1<sup>er</sup> numero—Janvier, 1821) in a paper entitled, “Memoir sur le Méchanisme
de L’Absorption.” The results contained in this essay are the more interesting
to me, as they were read at the Academy of Sciences at Paris, some time
after the publication of the Third Edition of my <span class='sc'>Pharmacologia</span>, and it will be
observed, in what a satisfactory manner they confirm the views which I offered at
that time, respecting the influence of venesection in accelerating the absorption of
Mercury. In the Fourth Edition (published in October, 1820, p. 115,) these views
were farther extended, and as I could not have been influenced by the experiments
of M. Majendie, which were not published until some time afterwards, it is very fair
to conclude, that when two persons arrive at the same result by different trains of
investigation, such a result must be correct. The conclusions established by the
experimental inquiries of M. Majendie, with regard to absorption, appear to me to
be so important, in reference to the object of the present work, that I shall pause,
in this place, for the purpose of furnishing the reader with a short account of them.
M. Majendie states, that while performing the experiment of injecting warm water
into the veins of a living animal, he first conceived the idea of observing what
effects would be produced upon the function of absorption by the artificial plethora,
thus occasioned; having accordingly injected a quantity of water into the venous
system of a middle-sized dog, he introduced a small portion of an active substance,
whose effects were well known, into his side, when he was surprised to find that its
usual operation was not manifested until after an interval much longer than usual;
the same experiment was afterwards repeated upon another animal, and with similar
results. In a third experiment, as much water (about two pounds) was injected,
as the animal could sustain without destruction, in which case the poisonous
substance produced no effect whatever, the powers of absorption appearing to be
entirely suspended: and having waited during half an hour for the occurrence of
those symptoms which, under ordinary circumstances, would have manifested themselves
in two minutes, M. Majendie concluded that if vascular congestion be the
cause of the suspension of absorption, the function ought to be restored by the removal
of this artificial condition, an opinion which he proceeded to verify by experiment;
the jugular vein of the animal, under trial, was accordingly opened, and
the ingenious operator had the satisfaction to observe the effects of the poison gradually
developing themselves in proportion as the blood flowed. M. Majendie next
proceeded to confirm the truth of his position, by an experiment, the converse of
those above related; an animal was bled, to the amount of about half a pound, and
the poisonous substance applied to the pleura of the animal, as in the foregoing experiments,
when it appeared that those effects which, under ordinary circumstances,
were not evident until after a period of twelve minutes, manifested themselves after
an interval of only thirty seconds. In order to shew that these results actually
arose from vascular distention, and not from the artificial state of dilution in which
the blood was placed, M. Majendie instituted the following experiment: a considerable
quantity of blood was drawn from the vein of a dog, and replaced by a similar
quantity of warm water, after which a measured quantity of Nux Vomica in solution
was introduced into the side, when the poisonous effects were found to take
place with the same rapidity as if the blood had not been mixed with water.</p>

vegetable which has been generally considered as a specific Emmenagogue; with
some authors, the Rubia Tinctorum, Madder; with others, the Sinapis alba have
been regarded as remedies of this nature; and lately Polygala Senega has been extolled
by the American practitioners; in modern times, however, few substances
have been more confidently recommended as uterine stimulants than the Secale
Cornutum, or Ergot, but of which I have no practical knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r157'>157</a>. Saline bodies would appear to be the peculiar stimuli of these organs, the principal
use of which is to separate such saline matter from the blood, as would otherwise
accumulate in the system. That these saline diuretics actually pass off by the
kidneys, may be satisfactorily shewn by an examination of the urine, in which the
bodies in question may be chemically detected. Let any person swallow several
doses of Nitre, taking care that the bowels are not disturbed by the medicine, and
he will find by dipping some paper into his urine, and afterwards drying it, that it
will deflagrate, and indicate the presence of nitre.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r161'>161</a>. The cutaneous discharge is very materially modified by the state of the atmosphere,
in its relations to moisture and dryness: when the air contains much moisture
it is a bad conductor of the perspirable matter, which therefore, instead of being carried
off in an insensible form, is condensed upon the surface; hence we appear to
perspire greatly upon the slightest exercise, whereas the cuticular discharge is at such
times absolutely less. We have all experienced the sensation of heat, and disposition
to sweating, during the moist weather which so frequently occurs in this country
in April and May, the wind being at the time stationary at south-west or south.
On the contrary, during the prevalence of an east wind, the most violent exercise
will scarcely prove diaphoretic, and yet the quantity of cutaneous exhalation is far
greater than during that state of atmosphere when the slightest exercise deluges us
with perspirable matter.</p>

Abassides, is said to have been cured by a nearly similar method. His physician
caused him to enter a lime-kiln soon after the lime had been removed, when in the
course of a few days he was totally cured of his dropsy. The ancients excited
sweating in this disease, by burying the patient up to the neck in heated sand or
ashes (<em>Celsus</em>, Lib. iii. c. 30.), and Lysons cured cases by placing his patients in
rooms heated to a very high temperature.</p>

by disease as to lose their control, or what Dr. Fordyce called their ‘governing
power,’ in which case they would appear to be unable to prevent the matters which
they contain from acting chemically upon each other, and occasioning decompositions
and new combinations: in such cases substances are sometimes developed in
the internal organs by the action of disease, which are capable of producing a chemical
effect upon the fluids; for instance,—an acid is not unfrequently generated in
the bowels of children which decomposes the bile and produces a green precipitate,
and green stools are the consequence; in other cases the acid combines with the
<em>Soda</em> of the bile, and the precipitate thus occasioned is thick, viscid, very bitter, and
inflammable, and we have stools looking like pitch. In Yellow Fever, and in several
other diseases, the bile which is brought up by vomiting is frequently of a vivid
green colour, and some writers have attributed the phenomenon to a morbid condition,
or action of the liver or gall bladder; the fact however is, that the bile itself
undergoes a chemical change in the Duodenum and Stomach. That bile does undergo
such a change from decomposition, is proved by a variety of facts observed to
take place <em>out</em> of the body; it is well known, for instance, that the fæces of infants,
although yellow when voided, frequently become green after some time, and Dr.
Heberden observes, in his Commentaries, that the urine of a certain jaundiced patient,
which was of a deep yellow, became after a few hours green: in such cases
it is probable that an acid is generated by the reaction of the elements of which the
bile consists.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r195'>195</a>. This fact derives its pathological interest from the probability that, in certain
states of disease, the Lithic acid assumes this peculiar modification, giving to the
sediments of urine those beautiful hues which were formerly considered by Proust,
as the effect of an acid, which he named the Rosacic; now as the Purpuric acid,
or rather the Purpurate of Ammonia, says Dr. Prout, is nothing more than Lithic
acid modified by the action of Nitric acid, and as I have already shewn that the
Pink and Lateritious sediments occasionally contain nitric acid in some peculiar
state of combination, the nature and origin of the colouring matter cease to be problematical.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r196'>196</a>. Whence is derived the large quantity of Phosphoric acid which is daily evacuated
from the system?—The researches of modern chemistry have furnished a very
satisfactory solution of this problem, by demonstrating its presence in those animal
and vegetable substances which are used by us as food. Mr. Barry, in prosecuting
his interesting and important experiments on the preparation of Pharmaceutical Extracts
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</span></i>, discovered the curious fact, that Phosphoric acid is to be found in
all the extracts in a soluble state; and on extending the investigation, says he, it was
ascertained that this acid, besides that portion of it which exists as phosphate of lime,
is contained in a vast variety of vegetables, and more especially in those which are
cultivated. Medico-Chirug. Trans. Vol. 10, p. 240.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f197'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r197'>197</a>. The urine of infants and nurses contains very little phosphate of lime and phosphoric
acid; it is not until after ossification is finished, that these elements are found
in abundance in the urinary fluid. That of old men, on the contrary, contains a
great quantity of them; the bony system, already overcharged with phosphate of
lime, refuses to admit more of it. This saline substance would ossify every part, as
it does sometimes in the arteries, ligaments, cartilages, and membranes, if the urine
were not to remove the greater part of this superabundant portion. In Rachitis it
is by the urine that the phosphate of lime passes off, the absence of which causes
the softness of bones. (Richerand). If we might be allowed to theorise, I should
say, that this disease depends upon a deficient action in the powers of assimilation,
in consequence of which the phosphoric acid is incapable of entering into its assigned
combinations, and is therefore eliminated as excrementitious. Dr. Glisson considered
the disease to depend upon some fault in the spinal marrow, whence he termed
it Rachitis, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥακὶς</span> Spina Dorsi.</p>

Xanthic Oxide, because it forms a lemon coloured compound when acted upon by

<p class='c007'><a href='#r201'>201</a>. I am by no means disposed to reject altogether, as a popular fallacy, the general
opinion in favour of the anti-lithic virtues of malt liquor; the observations which
have been already offered (page 79) will explain how such agents may occasionally
operate in assisting digestion. In the observations made upon the Bills of Mortality
in the year 1662, by an ingenious citizen, concerning the increase of some

great quantities of lime in their urine; I have known the same also to take place

<div class='footnote' id='f216'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r216'>216</a>. This conceit does not appear to have been confined to the ignorant alone, for
we learn from Spratt’s History of the Royal Society, that very shortly after the institution
of that learned body, a series of questions was drawn up by their direction,
for the purpose of being submitted to the Chinese and Indians, which clearly
shews their belief in the possibility of such an operation, viz. “Whether the Indians
can so prepare that stupifying herb, Datura, that they make it lie several days,
months, years, according as they will have it, in a man’s body, without doing him
any hurt, and at the end kill him without missing half an hour’s time?”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f217'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r217'>217</a>. Dr. Mead adopted this opinion, but he became so convinced of its inadequacy
that, in the later editions of his work on Poisons, he withdrew the hypothesis. It
is hardly necessary to observe that upon its abandonment, a host of popular antidotes
at once fell into disuse; for as long as the injury was supposed to arise from mechanical
irritation, oils, fats, and other similar remedies were held capable of obtunding
the acrimony. So has the abandonment of other conceits and hypotheses cleared
away many absurd articles from the list of Antidotes; see page <a href='#Page_26'>26</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f218'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r218'>218</a>. The introduction of poisons into the body through the medium of the circulation
of the blood is frequently alluded to by the physiologists of the seventeenth
century. I have lately met with a curious passage in a work entitled “Popular
Errours in Physick, first written in Latine by the learned physitian, James Penrose,
Doctor in Physick. London, 1651.” “The venome is carried by the veines and
arteries, as appeares in that all the blood of them that have been bitten by a viper doth
turne into a pale greennesse. And seeing that the veines in the papps are so very
slender, and doe not come unto the heart, but with a great many long windings, I
affirme, and it is more probable, that if the viper be applyed to the feet, which are
farthest remote from the heart, it will sooner infect the heart than if to the papps,
but soonest of all if it be applied to the armes. And now the story of <span class='sc'>Cleopatra</span>
comes to my minde. <span class='sc'>Petrus Victorius</span> blames the painters, that paint Cleopatra
applying the aspe to her papps, seeing it is manifest out of <span class='sc'>Plutarch</span> in the life of
<span class='sc'>Antonius</span>, and out of <span class='sc'>Plinie</span> likewise, that she applyed it to her arme. <span class='sc'>Zonaras</span>
relates that there appeared no signe of death upon her, save two blew spots on her
arme. <span class='sc'>Cæsar</span> also in her statue which he carryed in triumph, applyed the aspe to
her arme; for in the armes there are great veines and arteries, which doe quickly,
and in a straight way convey the venome to the heart, whereas in the papps the vessels
are slender. And therefore in <span class='sc'>Saint Paul</span> the miracle was so much the greater,
in that he felt no harme from the viper, which layd hold on his hand, for if it had
assailed him on the breast, he had had respite enough to take some antidote.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f219'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r219'>219</a>. There can be no doubt but that death has been produced by the mechanical
operation of various insoluble bodies; although we cannot believe the numerous
tales recorded on the subject of diamond dust (supposed to constitute the basis of the
celebrated “Powder of Succession”) or of powdered glass, &amp;c. Numerous cases
are recorded where life has been destroyed by the lodgement of substances in the
intestines; and we have lately heard of the fatal effects produced by alvine accumulations
from the habitual use of Magnesia. With respect to the danger from the ingestion
of glass and enamel in powder, there still exists much difference of opinion;
Caldani, Mandruzzato, and M. Le Sauvage, report experiments made upon men
and animals, in which no bad consequences followed; on the other hand, Schurigius
(Chylologia) and Cardanus (De Venenis) cite instances where persons have died of
ulcerations of the stomach from such causes; and M. Portal, Foderé, (Medicine
Legale) Plouquet (Comment. super Homicid.) Stoll, (Ratio Medendi, part vi. p. 60)
Gmelin (Hist. General de Ven. mineral.) Frank (Man. de Toxicol.) furnish testimony

marrow were equally deficient, notwithstanding which, it even exceeded the
usual size, the heart was also perfect, and it was evident that the circulation had
been properly performed. No sooner however was the monster born than it perished,
because the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration were unable to perform
their functions without the aid of nervous excitement; no air was therefore inhaled
into the lungs, and in a few minutes the heart ceased to contract from the deficient
supply of oxygenized blood. See <span class='sc'>Medical Jurisprudence</span>, Vol. ii. “On the Physiological

its physiological action from the Infusion of that vegetable poison; the former we
have stated, affects the brain only, the latter we now learn, when taken into the alimentary
canal, suspends the action of the heart. This apparent anomaly at first led
Mr. Brodie, as he has since informed me, to suspect the accuracy of his experiments:
and I suggested to him, whether a probable explanation might not be derived from
the late chemical researches into the composition of tobacco, which have shewn the
existence of two active principles, viz. <em>Nicotin</em>, and an <em>Essential Oil</em>? Where an
infusion is employed, we seem to obtain the influence of the former, and the effects
are displayed upon the heart; but where the oil is applied, the <em>Nicotin</em> has been removed,
and the brain is the organ principally affected—see Tabaci Folia.</p>

substance, which sometimes adhere with such obstinacy to the coats of the stomach
as to defy the exertions of an emetic to detach them, especially if the poison be arsenic;
but let the practitioner remember that this practice can never be allowed
until all that can be ejected by vomiting or purging has been previously removed;
then perhaps the ingestion of Magnesia, or an Alkaline Salt, as proposed by Mr.
Marshall, might be admissible, but it should be quickly followed up by fresh emetics
and purgatives.</p>

cannot invalidate the claim of Dr. Fordyce, as the first person who generalized the
fact, and applied it with success to practice. <span class='sc'>Diemerbroeck</span>, in his notes upon the
Theriaca Andromachi, observes that the composition is a more efficacious medicine
from the concurrent powers of so many ingredients, alike in virtue: and Quincy, in
his Lectures on Pharmacy, which were published by Dr. Shaw in 1723, says “those
fetid gums which are generally prescribed in Hysteria, as Ammoniacum, Galbanum,

other aromatics; their object was to remove or prevent the indigestion which might
be occasioned by eating too copiously at the marriage entertainment. It must be
acknowledged that this compound was better adapted for such a purpose than the
modern Bride-cake, to which it gave origin. Cato (de R. R. c. 121) has given us a
receipt for the Roman bride-cake.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f244'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r244'>244</a>. Dr. Majendie goes so far even as to assert, that by varying the different preparations of the <em>same</em> Narcotic, we shall be better able to keep up its action on the animal
œconomy, without an increase of its dose. He adds, “Some English writers
have denied the truth of this observation: but they have not given any reasons for
their scepticism.—Why should it not be true?”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f245'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r245'>245</a>. It would even appear probable that in some cases mercurial influence has, after
its subsidence, been renewed by doses of Opium: a remarkable instance of this
kind is related in Hufeland’s Journal (vol. ix.) in which an old woman is said to
have fallen into a considerable salivation after every dose of Opium; she had previously
applied to the physician for an extensive ulceration over her body, and had
taken a considerable quantity of mercury; but the effects had subsided, until renewed
by the opium.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f246'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r246'>246</a>. It has been observed under the history of Emetics (p. 84), that in cases of profound
intoxication, or in those of violent wounds and contusions of the head, vomiting
will not take place, however forcibly the stomach may be goaded by an
emetic, whereas if the brain be only partially influenced, as by incipient intoxication,
or by a less violent blow on the head, its irritability is increased instead of being
paralysed, and that vomiting under such circumstances is excited by the slightest
causes; just so is it with regard to Narcotics, a powerful dose so paralyses the nervous
system, that the stomach cannot be made to reject its contents, as every one
must have observed in cases of narcotic poisoning, while smaller doses, like lesser
injuries of the head, dispose the stomach to sickness.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f247'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r247'>247</a>. Sir Gilbert Blane has advanced an ingenious hypothesis to explain the cause of
the fœtid breath of persons under the influence of mercury; which might perhaps
also shew why certain remedies are rendered more efficient by combination with
mercury. One of the active effects of mercury, says Sir Gilbert, is to <em>alter the natural
sensibility of the Lacteals</em>, so that when under its influence, they absorb indiscriminately
that which is excrementitious and nutritive; hence the smell of the
breath, since the fœtid particles are carried into the circulation, and thrown off in
the halitus of the lungs, or by the salivary glands, in consequence of the mouth of
the lacteals losing that selecting tact, whereby in their sound state they reject whatever is offered to them, except the chyle. Now if mercury acts as the “<em>Soporata
Offa</em>” to the lacteals, it is evident that its combination with active matter may, on
some occasions, facilitate the absorption of the latter.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f248'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r248'>248</a>. In some cases, however, the energy of an active bitter would seem to be diminished
by an alkali; and it may therefore be more prudent to administer such
substances at different periods. I apprehend that the powers of <em>Squill</em> are thus invalidated
by a fixed alkali.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r251'>251</a>. If the facts stated in this section be true, we are bound to recognise two orders
of medicinal elements,—the one comprehending those that possess an inherent and
independent activity,—the other, those that are in themselves inert, but which are
capable of imparting impulse and increased energy to the former when combined
with them. As this is a new view of the subject of vegetable combinations, no apology
is necessary for the introduction of new terms for its explanation; I therefore
propose to designate the former of these <span class='sc'>Substantive</span>, and the latter, <span class='sc'>Adjective</span>
constituents. When the structure of vegetable remedies shall have been thoroughly
examined upon this principle of combination, much medicinal obscurity will be removed,
and probably some pharmaceutical improvements of value suggested; at
all events it will teach a lesson of prudent caution to the pharmaceutic chemist; it
will shew the danger of his removing this or that element from a vegetable compound,
merely because he finds, upon its separation, that it is inert. I dwell the
more upon this point, because I feel that there never was a period in the history of
medicine, at which such a caution was more necessary; for while the poly-pharmacy
of our ancestors has driven the physician of the present day into a simplicity
of prescription that on many occasions abridges his powers and resources, the progress
of chemical knowledge has diffused through the class of manufacturing chemists
a bold spirit of adventure and empiricism,—a mischievous propensity to torture
our best remedies, in order to concentrate or extract the parts which they consider
to constitute their essential ingredients.</p>

experiments of this laborious chemist it would appear, that odours are not as Fourcroy
supposed, <em>the effect of the simple solution of certain bodies in air</em>, but that for their
developement, some third body (coinciding in its office with my <span class='sc'>Adjective</span> constituent)
possessing in itself none of the characteristic odour, is absolutely necessary
as an intermede, varying in its nature according to that of each odorous body, in
the same way that the mordant requires to be varied by the dyer, according to the
nature of the colouring matter which it is intended to fix on the cloth;—thus Ambergris
has in itself very little odour, but the addition of Musk developes  a very strong and
decided one; this also happens in a less degree with Lavender, and the perfumers
therefore add a small quantity of musk to the distilled water of this plant. In other
cases, Ammonia lends, as it were, its volatility to bodies, the odour of which without
such an auxiliary, would be scarcely sensible; this is exemplified by the practice
of perfumers exposing their musk and other substances to the atmosphere of privies
when they lose their power: (<em>Paul Amman: Manduct: ad Mat: Med:</em>) so again in
order to give pungency to snuff it is made to suffer the commencement of fermentation,
in which case ammonia is generated; and it is a curious fact that the odour
of the best snuff may be destroyed by mixing with it a little tartaric acid, by which
its ammoniacal salt is neutralized. In some instances the <em>adjective</em> ingredient seems
to be Sulphur, as in the essential oils of some cruciform plants, and particularly in
that of mustard seed, for M. Robiquet found that this oil lost its odour by being kept
in contact with a metallic surface, and that an inodorous oil remained, while the metal
became a sulphuret: perhaps, adds M. Robiquet, it may be sometimes necessary
for the full and exquisite developement of odour in these bodies to add another vehicle,
thus the addition of a little Acetic acid heightens the odour of Mustard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Iron has little, or no odour; but when volatilized with hydrogen, its odour is very
powerful. The smell of copper and brass must depend upon some circumstance
not well understood.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f252'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r252'>252</a>. Astruc, and other practitioners of the same school, always premised a mercurial
course with venesection: it is probable that many of the anomalies observed in
the modern application of this remedy may have arisen from an inattention to the
diet of those who are under mercurial influence. Mercury is in itself a most powerful
stimulant, and ought therefore to be accompanied with depletion and low
diet; besides which, the experiments of Majendie have shewn how greatly such a
state of the system will expedite the effects of the mercurial remedy.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f253'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r253'>253</a>. Dr. Eberle, of Philadelphia, in a work lately published, has quoted the above
passage, and remarks, that he has long been acquainted with the fact which it announces;
although he proposes to account for it by a different train of reasoning;
he considers that Nauseants encourage mercurial ptyalism, by favouring an afflux to
the salivary glands. The learned author must allow me to congratulate him upon
this fortunate discovery; unless his patients be blessed with as much apathy as was
ever assumed by the Gilbertine order of Benedictines, he need never in future despair
of influencing them by mercury. He has only to condemn the refractory to
meagre fare, and then to tantalize them, as poor Sancho was, in his government,
with the sight, or rather smell, of a savoury dish, and he will without doubt secure
his object,—but, to be serious, if Dr. Eberle’s views be correct, how will he explain
the modus operandi of <em>fear</em>, as related in the text? for the tendency of fear is to <em>diminish</em>
the salivary secretion, as will be hereafter mentioned.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f254'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r254'>254</a>. Fear, contrary to joy, decreases, for a time, the action of the extremities of the
arterial system, as is seen by the sudden paleness which succeeds, and the shrinking
or contraction of the vessels of the skin. M. de Haen relates the case of a painter
who suffered convulsions, which were succeeded by a return of his colic. In this
case the poison which had been, for a long time, admitted into his constitution in
consequence of his daily employment, was, by the passion of anger, immediately
brought into action. It was formerly observed by Citois, that the inhabitants of the
province of Poitou, who had suffered anxiety of mind on account of any misfortune
to themselves or family, were particularly susceptible of the disease.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f255'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r255'>255</a>. How admirably do the results of Majendie’s experiments coincide with this reasoning;
see page 84; and yet Dr. Eberle, in the work quoted below, appears unwilling
to admit such a theory.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r257'>257</a>. In the same manner is the salivary secretion immediately influenced by the operation
of the mind; the sight of a delicious repast to a hungry man is not more effectual
in exciting it, than is the operation of fear and anxiety in repressing and suspending
it. Whence we are led to believe, that the Hindoo Ordeal by Rice may
have occasionally assisted in the ends of Justice. This ordeal was conducted in
the following manner. The persons suspected of any crime being assembled in a
ring, a certain portion of dried rice was given to each, which they were directed to
chew for some minutes, and then to turn it out of their mouths upon the leaves or
bark of a tree. Those who were capable of returning it in a pulpy form were at
once acquitted, while those from whose mouths it came out dry, were pronounced
guilty. See Medical Jurisprudence, Introduct. Vol. 1. p. viii.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r258'>258</a>. The capacity of our digestive organs sufficiently testifies that nature never intended
them for the reception of highly concentrated food, while this idea is farther
strengthened by perceiving how sparingly she produces concentrated aliment; the
saccharine matter of esculent fruits is generally blended with acidulous and mucilaginous
ingredients; and the oleaginous principle of seeds, kernels, and other similar
substances, is combined with farinaceous matter: the capacity observable in the
organs of graminivorous animals evidently shews that they were also designed for a
<em>large bulk</em> of food, and <em>not</em> for provender in which the nutritive matter is concentrated;
the gramineous and leguminous vegetables do not present their nutritive
matter in a separate state, nor is the animal furnished with an apparatus by which he
can separate the chaff and straw from the grain,—the obvious inference is, that he
was intended to feed indiscriminately on both.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some years ago I constructed a Logometric scale of Equivalents, analogous in
principle to that which I have now introduced under the title of the “<span class='sc'>Medicinal
Dynameter</span>,” to shew the relative nutritive strength of different vegetables, and to
work problems connected with them; I soon found, however, that unless <em>bulk</em> was
taken into calculation, it was incapable of furnishing even an approximation to
truth.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r270'>270</a>. The most subtle of all poisons,—<em>the matter of febrile contagion</em>,—is certainly
modified in activity by the degree of moisture in the atmosphere influencing its solubility;
the Plague is said to be most common in Egypt after the inundation of the
Nile, a period at which the atmosphere is necessarily saturated with water; according
to the account of Sir Robert Wilson, the English and Turkish armies that
marched to Cairo escaped contagion, while the troops that remained stationary on
the moist shore of Aboukir, were very severely visited. On the other hand, the
<em>Harmattan</em>, a wind experienced on the western coast of Africa, between the Equator
and fifteen degrees <em>North Latitude</em>, blowing from north-east towards the Atlantic,
and which, in consequence of its passage over a very extensive space of arid
land, is necessarily characterized by excessive dryness, puts an end to all Epidemics,
as the Small Pox; and infection at such a time does not appear to be easily
communicable even by art. <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>, vol. 21.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difficulty of communicating infection to animals during a dry state of the air,
as remarked on the Western Coasts of Africa, during the blowing of the <em>Harmattan</em>,
agrees with some observations on Plague by the French physicians, as this complaint
first made its appearance in the French army during a moist state of the air
in Syria, when it lay under the walls of Jaffa in February, 1800.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a well known fact that volatile bodies are sooner converted into a gaseous
state by the presence of water in the atmosphere; this is strikingly exemplified by
the greater rapidity with which <em>Limestone</em> is burnt and reduced to quick-lime in moist
weather, and by the assistance which is rendered in a dry season, by placing a pan
of water in the ash-pit; so again the perfume of flowers is most sensible when the
air is humid, as during the fall of the evening dew, or in the morning when the dew
evaporates, and is dissipated by the rays of the rising sun; for the same reason the
stench of putrid ditches and common sewers, is conveyed to the organs of smell
much more speedily in summer previous to rain, when the air is charged with
moisture.</p>

In India, Betel, variously compounded, is employed for the purpose above
stated. The mixture more commonly used in Ceylon consists of quick-lime, Arecanut,
and Tobacco, wrapped in Betel leaf. On ordinary occasions it is only masticated;
but to repress the painful calls of hunger, the juice is swallowed.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r274'>274</a>. Dr. MacCulloch, in illustration of this subject, states, that ink, paste, and seeds,
are among the common articles which suffer from such a cause, and to which this
remedy is easily applicable. With respect to articles of food, such as bread, cold
meats, or dried fish, it is less easy to apply the remedy, on account of the taste;
cloves, however, and other spices whose flavours are grateful, may sometimes be
used for this end. It is notorious that gingerbread, and bread containing caraway
seeds, are far less liable to mouldiness than plain bread. The effect of cloves in preventing
the mouldiness of ink is generally known; and the same result may be obtained
by oil of lavender in a very minute quantity, or by any other of the perfumed
oils. Russian leather, which is perfumed with the tar of the Birch tree, is not subject
to mouldiness, as must be well known to all who possess books thus bound;
they even prevent it from taking place in books which are bound in calf, and near
which they may happen to lie. Paste is another perishable article, and although
<em>Alum</em> which is used by the book-binder will certainly preserve it longer than it
would remain useful without it, still it is not very effectual. <em>Rosin</em>, sometimes used
by the shoemaker, answers the purpose better, and appears to act entirely on this
principle; it is however far less effectual than even oil of turpentine; <em>Lavender</em>, and
the other strong perfumes, as <em>Peppermint</em>, <em>Anise</em>, and <em>Bergamot</em>, are perfectly effectual,
even in a very small quantity, and paste may be thus preserved for any length
of time.</p>

<span class='sc'>Diuretics</span>, that some medicines not only assist, but actually <span class='fss'>DIRECT</span> the operation
of the substances with which they may be associated, and that many remedies act
in unison with those they are joined with; thus <em>Nitre</em> in conjunction with <em>Squill</em> is
diuretic; in conjunction with <em>Guaiacum</em>, diaphoretic; for these reasons I hesitated
whether I ought not to have added a fifth <em>constituent</em>, and restored the “<em>Dirigens</em>”
of ancient authors; enough, however, has been said to enable the practitioner to

<div class='footnote' id='f277'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r277'>277</a>. Dr. Percival in his Essays, ingenuously exemplifies this error by stating a case

Camphor and Balsam of Copaiba in the form of pills, but the apothecary informed
me that he was unable to form them into a mass, since they liquefied like treacle.”

no longer strike a black colour with the salts of iron: another example is afforded

into the fire dissipates itself in smoke, whereas Frankincense burns with a brisk flame,
and with an odour that serves to detect the imposition.” “Some authors, adds Dr.

At the same time it must be acknowledged, that there are certain phenomena

thus if Lime water be boiled with <em>animal</em> charcoal, the whole of the lime

it is distilled.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r332'>332</a>. Or it may be detected, in very minute quantities, by the elegant test lately employed
by Dr. Marcet, and which I have frequently repeated in my Lectures with
considerable satisfaction. It consists in adding a little sulphuric acid with a small
quantity of muriate of soda, and then immersing a little gold leaf in the mixture,
when after boiling it, if any nitric acid should have been present, the gold leaf will
be dissolved.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f333'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r333'>333</a>. It had been long known that by the destructive distillation of any kind of wood,
an acid is obtained, which was formerly considered of a distinct and peculiar nature,
and termed Acid Spirit of Wood, and afterwards Pyroligneous Acid. Glauber appears
to have been the first chemist who was aware of its true nature, for he speaks
of it as the “Vinegar of Wood.” It was however reserved for Fourcroy and Vauquelin
to demonstrate its composition by experiment, and they have accordingly
proved beyond doubt that it is merely the Acetic acid, contaminated with Empyreumatic
oil and Bitumen. The address of modern chemists has at length enabled
them to get rid of every trace of these latter ingredients, and to furnish an acid perfectly
devoid of any foreign flavour. The crude pyroligneous acid, as it is first received,
is rectified by a second distillation in a copper still, in the body of which
about 20 gallons of viscid tarry matter are left from every 100. It has now become
a transparent brown vinegar, having a considerable empyreuma; it is then redistilled
and saturated with quick-lime, and the liquid acetate is evaporated to dryness
and submitted to gentle torrefaction, in order to dissipate the empyreumatic matter,
and lastly the calcareous salt is decomposed by sulphuric acid, when a pure, perfectly
colourless, and grateful vinegar rises in distillation.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f334'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r334'>334</a>. This instrument was invented by Messrs. Taylors for this particular purpose; the
principle consists in forming a neutral salt with dry hydrate of lime and the acid to
be examined, and then taking the specific gravity of the solution. Act 58. G. III. c.
65, § 8.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f335'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r335'>335</a>. It may be necessary to state, that the Pharmaceutist should never purchase acetic
acid of greater strength than that of 75° of the Acetometer, when it is intended
for dilution, for although he might thus avoid the expense of carriage, the saving
will be more than counterbalanced by the excessive duty levied upon acids above
that standard. There is moreover a great loss in the preparation of strong acids, so
that the manufacturer cannot afford to sell them at a price which is merely proportional
to their strength. Acid of 75° is regularly kept by Messrs. Beaufoy for dilution,
and if mixed with eleven parts of pure water is equivalent to the common distilled
vinegar of the Pharmacopœia.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f336'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r336'>336</a>. It ought to have been 1·048 of 55° Fah: but the error lies in the scale of Taylor’s
Acetometer, which appears to be incorrect at this point.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f337'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r337'>337</a>. I believe that no manufacturer, except Messrs. Beaufoy, makes an acid stronger
than this; the College sample was obtained from that house.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f338'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r338'>338</a>. The Reviewer of Mr. Phillip’s Translation of the Pharmacopœia, in the Royal
Institution Journal for July, 1824, has fallen into an important error upon this subject,
against which it may be necessary to caution the reader; he says, “the term
‘<em>diluted acetic acid</em>’ is properly enough applied to Distilled Vinegar, but the process
of distillation might well have been rejected; for all medical purposes a dilute acid,
composed of one part of the concentrated acid, contained in the Materia Medica,
and four parts of water, is preferable. Of this mixture, or of distilled vinegar, the
specific gravity should be 1·009, and 1000 grains should saturate 145 grains of Sub-carbonate
of Soda.” The reviewer has mistaken the acid of sp. gr. 1·043 mentioned
by Phillips, as the strongest he has met with, for the Pharmacopœia acid of sp.
gr. 1·046; for, should he dilute the latter with only four times its weight of water,
he would produce a compound containing 5·686 per cent. of real acid, or one considerably
stronger than the strongest malt vinegar, and twice the strength of distilled
vinegar. The reviewer takes this occasion to indulge his favourite passion for abusing
the Pharmacopœia, and he asks with an air of sarcasm, Where was Dr. Paris
during the late revision? I answer—engaged in the discharge of my duty as a humble
member of the Committee, and I can assure him that nothing which he has yet
urged has convinced me that I have failed in its fulfilment, or erred in its execution:—but
it is now my turn to enquire, and I do so with perfect good humour, where
the reviewer could have been when he composed the above passage? that he was
<em>not at home</em>, is I think sufficiently evident from the statement which I have just offered.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f339'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r339'>339</a>. A very useful practical application has been made of the Pyroligneous Acid,
for the purpose of correcting the excessive fœtor attendant upon mortification. Dr.
Samuel W. Moore of this city, (to whom we are indebted for the suggestion,) has
detailed the particulars of a case of extensive mortification of the cheek, resulting
from the use of mercury, in which the acid was applied, and with the happiest success.
In a case of cancerous breast, it was also used with the same object, and
with similar effect. The mode of using it is simply to apply pieces of lint or linen
wet with the acid to the part affected. See New-York Medical Repository, Vol.
22. p. 237.—<em>Ed.</em></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f340'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r340'>340</a>. <span class='sc'>Aromatic Vinegar</span> is merely an acetic solution of camphor, oil of cloves, of
lavender, and of rosemary. The acetic acid used for this purpose is about 145° of
the acetometer, containing 68·5 per cent. of real acid. A preparation of this kind
may be extemporaneously made by putting ʒj of Acetate of Potass into a phial
with a few drops of some fragrant oil, and in m xx of Sulphuric Acid.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Thieves Vinegar</span>, or <span class='sc'>Marseilles Vinegar</span>, is a pleasant solution of essential
oils and camphor, in vinegar; the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia has given a formula
for its preparation under the title of “Acetum Aromaticum.” The repute of this
preparation as a prophylactic in contagious fevers is said to have arisen from the
confession of four thieves, who, during the plague of Marseilles, plundered the dead
bodies with perfect security, and, upon being arrested, stated on condition of their
lives being spared, that the use of Aromatic Vinegar had preserved them from the
influence of contagion. It is on this account sometimes called “Le Vinaigre des
quatre voleurs.” It was however long used before the Plague of Marseilles, for it
was the constant custom of Cardinal Wolsey to carry in his hand an orange, deprived
of its contents, and filled with a sponge which had been soaked in vinegar
impregnated with various spices, in order to preserve himself from infection, when
passing through the crowds which his splendour or office attracted. The first Plague
raged in 1649, whereas Wolsey died in 1531. The French Codex has a preparation
of this kind, consisting of an acetic infusion of various aromatic herbs and camphor,
which is termed <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Acetum Aromaticum Alliatum,” seu “Antisepticum” <em>vulgo</em></span> “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des
Quatre Voleurs</span>.” p. 108. The German Dispensatories abound with Medicated Vinegars,
chiefly aimed against Pestilential Diseases.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f341'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r341'>341</a>. The more familiar of these are <em>Bitter Almonds</em>, the <em>Cherry Laurel</em> (Lauro Cerasus,)
the leaves of the <em>Peach tree</em>, the kernels of fruit, pips of apples, &amp;c. The prussic
acid would appear to be most abundant in the thin pellicle that envelopes the
kernel; the fleshy parts of these fruits do not contain it, and even the berries of
the <em>Lauro Cerasus</em> may be eaten with impunity; and yet the distilled water, and oil
of this plant are the most destructive of all narcotic poisons, as was evinced by the
murder of Sir Theodosius Broughton, by Laurel Water; and by the untimely fate
of Dr. Price, of Guildford, in the year 1782, who professing to convert Mercury
into Gold, offered to repeat his experiments before an adequate tribunal, but put a
period to his existence before the appointed day, by a draught of Laurel Water.
Consistent with theory, the watery extract of Laurel is harmless, a fact easily explained,
since the narcotic acid is entirely volatilized before the fluid can assume
the consistence of an extract. The Laurel Water as a medicinal agent appears to
have been long known. Linnæus, informs us that it was frequently used in Holland,
in pulmonary consumption. (<em>Amænitat. Academ.</em> vol. iv. p. 40.) The Bark of the
<em>Prunus Padus</em>, or Bird Cherry Tree, was ascertained to contain Prussic acid, by M.
Bergemann, in 1811, and it is certainly a curious fact, as Dr. Granville has observed,
that superstitious people should have selected the berries of this shrub to form
necklaces, which are hung round the neck of children to prevent fits and allay
cough from teething. For farther information upon this subject, the reader may
consult “The Chronological recapitulation respecting the Introduction of the Prussic
acid into the Practice of Physic,” in the work of Dr. Granville, above cited.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r345'>345</a>. We agree with our author in the general estimate which he forms of the Prussic
Acid. The experience of practitioners in this country has by no means confirmed
the high expectations originally entertained of this article. <em>Ed.</em></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f346'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r346'>346</a>. The only mineral substances in which this acid has been found is the <em>Fer Azuré</em>
of Haiiy, and a new substance which is found accompanying Welsh Culm, and of
which I have given an account in the first volume of the Transactions of the Royal
Geological Society of Cornwall, although in this latter instance it is probably a product,
not an educt.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f347'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r347'>347</a>. The following is the chemical reasoning upon which this process is founded.
“The prime equivalent of prussic acid is exactly one-eighth of that of the mercurial
peroxide. But as the prussiate of mercury consists of two primes of acid to one of
base, or is in its dry crystalline state a <em>By-cyanide</em>, we have the relation of one to four
in the formation of that salt, when we act on the peroxide with cold prussic acid.”
Hence is derived the above simple rule of analysis. (Journal of Science and the
Arts.) Upon the same principle it has been already stated, that the quantity of real
acetic acid, in any given sample of distilled vinegar may be discovered by the test of
carbonate of lime, see <em>Acid. Acetic. Fort.</em> They furnish beautiful illustrations of the
practical importance of the doctrine of Definite Proportions.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f348'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r348'>348</a>. This offers a striking example of the confusion produced by the constant
changes in chemical nomenclature; in the former editions of this work, the term
<em>Hydro</em> was prefixed to <em>Muriatic Acid</em>, as an epithet expressive of the presence of
<em>water</em>, whereas the same word is now used to denote the existence of <em>Hydrogen</em> as
one of its elements.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f349'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r349'>349</a>. Dr. Powell directs only <em>two</em> parts of acid; but this is evidently too little, for it
appears by Dr. Wollaston’s scale, that 3 parts of salt require 2½ of oil of vitriol for
their decomposition; and in addition to this, the oxide of manganese will require a
farther addition to convert it into a sulphate.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f350'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r350'>350</a>. As Chlorine is by pressure condensable into a liquid, tubes containing a small
quantity of it, and hermetically sealed, might be very usefully employed for this purpose,
since by breaking off the extremity, the chlorine would instantly assume the
gaseous state, and diffuse itself through the apartment.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f351'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r351'>351</a>. There is a curious illustration of this fact in the German “<em>Ephemerides</em>;” the
case of a person is described who had taken so much Elixir of Vitriol that his keys
were rusted in his pocket, by the transudation of the acid through his skin!</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f352'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r352'>352</a>. Nitric acid may be considered as one of the most efficient agents in our possession
for exciting prompt vesication. For this purpose, we believe it was first used in
the epidemic Cholera of the East Indies, and the success which attended it in that
fatal disorder suggested its application in a variety of other diseases. The mode of
using it is to rub the surface intended to be vesicated, with the pure acid, and as soon
as pain is produced, to neutralize the acid by washing the part with a solution of
salt of tartar. If the object is to continue the irritation, a common blister may be
laid upon the part. <em>Ed.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>while by the Greeks, garlic was detested, although their husbandmen had been from

as it contains but a small proportion of saline matter, it is remarkably soft, although
it holds suspended mud, and vegetable and animal debris, which occasion it to undergo
a violent change on being kept: a large volume of carburetted and sulphuretted
hydrogen gases is evolved, and it becomes black and insufferably offensive;
upon racking it off however into large earthen vessels, and exposing it to the air, it
gradually deposits a quantity of black slimy matter, and becomes as clear as crystal,
and perfectly sweet and palatable, and is exceedingly well adapted for sea store.
“<span class='sc'>The New River Water</span>” contains a small proportion of muriate of lime, carbonate
of lime, and muriate of soda; it differs also in its gaseous contents: 100 cubic

<div class='footnote' id='f390'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r390'>390</a>. The law which determines such combinations has been investigated with singular
ingenuity and success by Dr. Murray, (Transactions of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, 1816). Berthollet had already established the important fact, that combinations
are often determined by the force of cohesion, in such a manner, that in
principles acting on each other, those on which this force operates most powerfully,
in relation to the fluid which is the medium of action, are combined together; hence
from a knowledge of the solubility of the compounds which substances form, we
may predict what combinations will be established when they act on each other,
those always combining which form the least soluble compounds. It is for the extension
of these views, and for the useful application of them, that we are indebted
to Dr. Murray, who justly observes that if the force of cohesion can so far modify
chemical attraction, as to establish among compound salts dissolved in any medium,
those combinations whence the least soluble compound are formed, we are entitled
to conclude that the reverse of this force, i. e. the power of a solvent, may produce
the opposite effects, or cause the very reverse of these combinations to be established,
so that in a concentrated medium the least soluble will be formed, and in a dilute
one, the more soluble compounds will be established. Hence follows the simple
rule by which the actual state in which saline bodies exist in a solution may be determined, viz. that in any fluid containing the elements of compound salts, the binary
compounds existing in it will be generally those which are most soluble in that
fluid, and the reverse combinations will only be established by its concentration
favouring the influence of cohesion. It appears that by simply evaporating a saline
solution we may produce changes in its composition, and obtain products which
never existed in its original state of dilution; thus, suppose muriate of magnesia and
sulphate of soda to be dissolved in water, as is actually the case in the water of the
ocean, and the solution to be concentrated by evaporation from heat; the combinations
of sulphate of magnesia and muriate of soda, being on the whole less soluble
in water, this circumstance of inferior solubility, or the force of cohesion thus operating,
actually determines the formation of these compounds; and the production
of sulphate of magnesia from the bittern is to be explained upon this principle.
Since it appears therefore that the influence of solubility is most important, temperature,
to whose dominion it is under all circumstances subject, must necessarily be
alike powerful; let us exemplify this fact by the action of the very salts under consideration;
it has been just stated that muriate of magnesia and sulphate of soda
decompose each other in a concentrated solution at a high temperature, producing
muriate of soda and sulphate of magnesia, but at temperatures below 32° the reverse
actually takes place, muriate of soda and sulphate of magnesia reacting, and being
converted into sulphate of soda and muriate of magnesia; a fact evidently owing to
the relation of the solubility of these salts to temperature. Muriate of soda has its
solubility scarcely altered, either by heat or cold; sulphate of soda is, in these respects,
completely the reverse; hence at an elevated temperature, muriate of soda
is the least, and sulphate of soda the most soluble salt, whilst at a low temperature,
the reverse of this happens. All the circumstances of this investigation are most
interesting; the medical practitioner will at once perceive its importance, as enabling
him to appreciate the real nature of saline solutions, and even in many instances
to preserve their identity. See Aquæ Minerales.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r391'>391</a>. There is a precaution respecting the preservation of these waters for analysis
with which the chemist ought to be acquainted; it will be fully explained by the relation
of the following anecdote. M. Wurza, on examining some bottles of Chalybeate
water, could detect no signs of iron in them, and on seeking for the cause of
this circumstance, he discovered it in the astringent nature of the corks which had
combined with the metallic substance, and abstracted it from the water.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r392'>392</a>. The Mineral Springs in the United States more especially deserving of notice,
are those of Saratoga and Ballston in the State of New-York, and of Schooley’s
Mountain in New-Jersey. Of the two first, various analyses have been published by
different chemists, but with so little uniformity of result as to leave their true chemical
character still in a state of uncertainty. An account of these discrepancies
may be seen in the New-England Journal of Medicine and Surgery for 1817. As
the analyses of Dr. Steel appear upon the whole to be most satisfactory, we shall
quote them. One gallon of the water was the quantity used in the experiments.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r400'>400</a>. It will probably afford a satisfactory explanation of the circumstance mentioned
by Dr. Percival, that the workmen who solder silver filligree with an arsenical alloy,
are never affected by the fumes. Dr. Percival does not appear to have been in the
least aware of the probable reason of this fact; he says, “This solder is melted by
the flame of a lamp directed by a blow-pipe; the greatest part of the arsenic is evaporated
by the blast and flame, and some part also of the rest of the solder, and yet
the men appear to enjoy as good health, and to live as long as other artists! Amongst
other examples of the truth of this observation, I lately saw in the manufactory at
the Soho at Birmingham, a man of more than fifty years of age, who had soldered
silver filligree for thirty-five years, and had regularly, during that period, passed
from eight to ten hours daily in his occupation, and yet he was fat, strong, active,
cheerful, and of a complexion by no means sickly; neither he nor his brother artists
use any means to counteract the effect of their trade.” Dr. Rotheram, in a letter
to Dr. Percival, comments upon this fact, and says, “how far the fluxes used in soldering
the filligree may fix the parts of the arsenic, or from what cause these workmen
might escape, I dare not say, but I should notwithstanding strongly suspect the
fumes of this very volatile and caustic mineral to be very prejudicial.”—I have
shewn above that arsenious acid is readily decomposed when heated in contact with
an oxidable metal, and I apprehend that this fact will explain the reason why the
fumes of the alloy in question are disarmed of their virulence.</p>

killed by her husband having insinuated powdered arsenic into the vagina, at the

l’Ourthe, aged 40, having died after a short illness, attended with considerable tumefaction
of the genital parts, uterine hemorrhage, vomiting, and purging, the body
was inspected by order of the mayor, when the surgeons reported that they found
the vulva in a state of gangrene, the abdomen much distended with air, and the intestines
inflamed and gangrenous. The culprit was arrested, convicted, and executed.”
In the Acts of the Society of Medicine of Copenhagen, a similar crime is
recorded, committed also by a peasant; in this latter case, although some small
pieces of arsenic were found within the vagina, yet, some doubting the possibility of
this species of poisoning, the magistrates consulted the College of Medicine of Copenhagen,
who decided the question in the affirmative, by instituting a series of experiments

from the fire, and then heated and pinched by the tongs, and at the same time bent
up at an acute angle, so as to be brought parallel to the body of the tube. The tube
is then to be heated a second time, and being again firmly pinched by the hot tongs,
the end will be found to be completely impervious. Where a glass is not at hand
Mr. R. Phillips says a common draught phial may be made to answer the purpose,
especially a <em>ten drachm</em> phial, for it is long in proportion to its diameter. In using it,
however, care must be taken that the suspected powder and black flux do not reach
the bottom, for, on account of its thickness, it will readily break on the application
of heat. The phial must therefore be heated laterally by means of a spirit lamp.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f408'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r408'>408</a>. In the celebrated case of Kesler, who was tried in the state of New-York some
few years ago, for having poisoned his wife with arsenic, this very question was
agitated, and gave rise to much learned controversy. The physicians originally
called to examine the body of the deceased, found, on dissection, the stomach and
intestines highly inflamed, and on the inner surface of the stomach, particles of a
vitreous appearance. These particles were subjected to various chemical tests, all
of which very strikingly concurred in confirming the suspicion that they were arsenic.
Upon this, in connexion with the other testimony adduced in the case, the prisoner
was found guilty and condemned to death. The minutes of the trial were transmitted
by the presiding judge (Yates) to Governor Clinton, who submitted the professional
part of them to Dr. M‘Nevin of New-York, for his opinion in relation to it.
Thus called upon, Dr. M. seems to have considered that his only duty was to find
fault. Objections were accordingly raised against every test hitherto employed by
the best chemists for the detection of arsenic. They were all pronounced to be
uncertain, and “<em>the only thing to be relied on</em>,” according to him, was “<em>the exhibition
of the metal itself in its metallic lustre and state</em>.” In consequence of this difference
of opinion, the execution of Kesler was suspended by the Governor, and the whole
case referred by him to the Legislature. That distinguished body appointed a committee
to investigate the business, and the result was that the original verdict of the
jury was confirmed by the Legislature, and the criminal was executed. It must
furnish a source of the purest gratification to the medical witnesses concerned in
this case, to find their opinions so unequivocally and so justly confirmed by an authority
so high as Dr. Paris. For a detailed account of this trial we refer to Beck’s
Medical Jurisprudence, vol. 2, p. 239.—<em>Ed.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r409'>409</a>. If any trifling opacity occur in a simple solution of arsenic, when assayed by
the nitrate of silver, it may be considered as the effects of some casual impurities;
this is further demonstrated by bringing over the surface of the arsenical liquid, a
piece of blotting paper, or a stopper, moistened with a solution of ammonia, when
there will instantly form a copious yellow precipitate of arsenite of silver. If this
experiment be performed on a surface of glass, laid over white paper, the result is
very striking and beautiful.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f412'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r412'>412</a>. In Wine and Porter, the solvent is probably Tartaric acid, for the Arsenite of
Silver is soluble in this as well as in the acetic and nitric acids. In Tea the solvent
would appear to be Tannin. The Arsenite of Silver is likewise dissolved by the
Tartaric acid, and also, but not so readily, by the Citric and Acetic acids.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f413'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r413'>413</a>. This opinion has lately received ample confirmation from the experiments of
Dr. Christison, (Edinb. Med. and Surg. Journal, July, 1824) who has shewn that
the process of Orfila is objectionable on the three following grounds, viz.</p>

<p class='c007'>1st. The colour is very seldom so entirely destroyed but that the precipitates produced
by some of the tests still deviate to a certain degree from their characteristic
tints; and although the colour of the fluid be even destroyed entirely, it often re-appears
in the precipitates.</p>

<p class='c007'>2d. Although the Chlorine destroys the colour, it does not also take from the fluid
its solvent action on the arsenical precipitates.</p>

<p class='c007'>3d. In fluids decolorized by Chlorine, and containing no Arsenic, some of the tests
produce precipitates, not only precisely the same with those which they cause in the
decolorized solutions of Arsenic, but likewise very similar in appearance to those
caused in a pure aqueous solution of Arsenic.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f414'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r414'>414</a>. The experiments by which I ascertained this fact were made soon after the publication
of Mr. Phillips’s paper, and long before I saw Dr. Christison’s communication
in the Edinburgh Journal. I merely mention this circumstance to add greater
weight to the experimental evidence, for when different persons arrive at the same
conclusion without any communication with each other, the strongest possible testimony
is afforded. I may also add that my suspicions were raised to the probability
of the fact by a knowledge of the action of charcoal upon lime water. In a philosophical
point of view the fact is one of great interest; it seems to connect the phenomena
of mechanical and chemical attraction. We have evidently a body removed
from the state of solution by mechanical means.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f415'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r415'>415</a>. The following is the formula for its preparation. Dissolve ten grains of lunar
caustic in ten times its weight of distilled water, to this add, <em>guttatim</em>, liquid ammonia,
until a precipitate is formed: continue cautiously to add the ammonia, repeatedly
agitating the mixture until the precipitate is nearly redissolved. The object of
allowing a small portion to remain undissolved is to guard against an excess of ammonia.
Wherever the test is used, the liquid to which it is added ought to be quite
cold.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f416'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r416'>416</a>. This is very important, for an excess of ammonia redissolves the yellow precipitate,
and therefore defeats the object of the test. The fixed alkalies, in excess,
have not such a property.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f417'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r417'>417</a>. The great impression made upon the public mind in Cornwall, by the above trial,
produced a disposition to regard the cause of every sudden death with more than
usual jealousy. See a Report of this trial in the Appendix of our work on Medical
Jurisprudence.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f418'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r418'>418</a>. In consequence of a report having arisen that a young woman had died after an
illness of forty-eight hours, and been hastily buried at Madron, the magistrates of
that district issued their warrant for the disinterment of the body, and requested
my attendance at the examination. It appeared upon dissection that the immediate
cause of death had been inflammation of the intestines; the stomach was found to
contain a considerable portion of liquid, which was carefully collected and examined;
no solid matter could be discovered in it. It appeared to consist principally
of the remains of a quantity of penny-royal tea, which had been the last thing
administered to the deceased. This was divided into several portions, and placed
in separate wine glasses, and submitted, in the presence of the sheriff and other
gentlemen, to a series of experiments, amongst which the following may be particularized,
as bearing upon the question at issue.</p>

<p class='c007'>1st. A few drops of a solution of sub-carbonate of potass were added to the liquid,
in one of the glasses, when its colour, which was before of a light hazel, was
instantly deepened into a reddish yellow; the sulphate of copper was then applied,
when a precipitate fell down, which every one present immediately pronounced to
be of a <em>vivid green</em> hue, but in pouring off the supernatant liquid, and transferring
the precipitate upon white paper, it assumed a blue colour, without the least tinge of
green; the explanation of the phenomenon, and the fallacy to which it gave rise,
was obvious: the yellow colour, imparted to the liquid by the alkali, was the effect
of that body upon vegetable extract, and will generally take place on adding it to
the infusions of vegetable substances.</p>

<p class='c007'>2nd. To another portion of the liquid, the ammoniaco-nitrate of silver was added;
a slight turbidness arose, but no yellow precipitate occurred.</p>

<p class='c007'>3rd. After adding a fixed alkali, the surface of the liquid was touched with a
stick of lunar caustic, but no yellow precipitate was produced.</p>

<p class='c007'>4th. The liquid was next assayed in a watch-glass, for a phosphate of soda, by
endeavouring to form a triple salt with magnesia and ammonia, as suggested by Dr.
Wollaston; the result proved that phosphate of soda was not present. It is unnecessary
to pursue the relation of the experiments; I conceive that sufficient evidence
has been adduced to establish the truth of the explanation. I have frequently
repeated the first experiment, substituting for the gastric infusion, a decoction of
onions, and with similar results.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f419'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r419'>419</a>. This explanation applies equally to the objection lately advanced by Dr. Porter,
of the University of South Carolina, who in observing on the tests for arsenic,
remarks, that an appearance similar to Scheele’s Green, is produced by the carbonate
of potass when added to a solution of copper containing coffee, but without
arsenic, more striking than if a weak solution of arsenic be used. Silliman’s Journal,
iii. 365.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f421'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r421'>421</a>. The habitudes of arsenious acid with the nitrates were first observed by Kunkel;
nitrous vapour is disengaged, part of the oxygen being absorbed by the arsenious
acid, by which an arsenite of potass is formed.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f422'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r422'>422</a>. Dr. Bostock confesses that where less than three-fourths of a grain were
used, he could not say that the metallic crust was clearly perceptible; and Dr.
Black considered that one grain was the smallest quantity which could be distinctly
recognised by such a process. Dr. Jaeger (Dissertatio Inauguralis, Stuttgard, 1808)
also observes, that he has been enabled to recognise the tenth of a grain of arsenious
acid, although mixed with sugar, by its odour, when thrown upon burning
coals! I must be allowed to question this fact; Dr. Jaeger, no doubt, believed that
he recognised the alliaceous odour, but it must have been the effect of imagination.
Dr. Bostock observes that, if Arsenic be mixed with either an animal or vegetable
substance, the smoke and smell arising from those bodies, when heated, will altogether
prevent our recognising its odour. He found that when a quantity of Arsenic
was mixed with an equal weight of flour, and placed upon iron at a low red heat,
so as not to cause the flour to inflame, the suffocating smoke that arose from the latter
could be alone perceived; nor was it possible to discover that any thing had
been mixed with it (Edinb. Med. Journal.) This objection of Dr. Bostock is true
in fact, although it admits of a different explanation, for at a low temperature the
Arsenious acid would be volatilized without decomposition; in which case no alliaceous
odour can be developed. Dr. Traill has lately asserted (Annals of Philosophy,
Feb. 1824) that he has recognised the alliaceous odour during the volatilization
of 1/78th of a grain of the metal. I do not question the truth of this assertion,
but there must have been an address in the manipulation which we cannot expect
to find in ordinary experimenters.</p>

met with a herb that was mortal: he that had eaten of it lost his memory and his
senses, and employed himself wholly in turning about all the stones he could find,
and after vomiting up bile, fell down dead.” (Plutarch’s Life of Anthony.) The
Scotch historian Buchannan relates, “that the Scots mixed a quantity of the juice
of the Belladonna (<em>Solanum Somniferum</em>) with the bread and drink which by their
truce they were to supply the Danes with, which so intoxicated them that the Scots

<p class='c007'><a href='#r434'>434</a>. In this country Bismuth has enjoyed for some years a reputation exceedingly
high. Dr. Samuel W. Moore, of New-York, was the first to call the attention of the
American medical public to it, in a valuable dissertation which was published
in the year 1810. In this Essay are recorded a number of cases illustrative of the
salutary effects of this medicine in spasmodic pain and other troublesome affections
of the stomach. In addition to its use in gastric disorders, Dr. Carmichael, of Virginia,
has administered it with success in the treatment of Intermittents. <em>Ed.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r435'>435</a>. Very lately our attention has been particularly called to this plant by Dr. E. G.
Ludlow of New-York, who speaks of it in terms of high commendation. He says
“the diseases in which I have used it are exclusively those of the Chylopoietic viscera,
as dyspepsia, diarrhœa and cholera. For the removal of pain and flatulence
in the bowels, which may be enumerated among the most frequent and distressing
symptoms of the first stage of indigestion, Calamus is superior to any other carminative;
by virtue of its aroma it creates a strong sensation of warmth in the stomach,
increasing its action without sensibly augmenting the force of the circulation, while
its powerful bitter principle gives permanent tone to the relaxed state of the fibres.”

form of administering the Calamus. The dose is from ℥ss to ℥j. <em>Ed.</em></p>

yet it is abundantly yielded by many other plants. It is said that what is imported
from Sumatra is the product of the Dryobobans Camphora. It is also contained
in the roots of the Cinnamon, Cassia, and Sassafras laurels, and in those of
Galangale, Zedoary, and Ginger; in Cardamom seeds and Long Pepper. The essential
oils of Lavender, Sage, Thyme, Peppermint, Rosemary, and those of many
other labiate plants yield camphor by distillation. Camphor may be also artificially
formed by driving a stream of muriatic gas through oil of turpentine; this factitious
product, however, is to be distinguished from native camphor in not being soluble
in weak nitric acid, and also in not being precipitated by water from its solution
in strong nitric acid.</p>

well known for his researches in crystallography, to undertake its examination; and
he observes that “The crystal of native Camphor (in the wood) appears as a flat octohedron;
but the primary form is a right rhombic prism of 51° 36′ and 128° 24′.
by measurement with the reflective goniometer on cleavage planes: the octohedral
appearance arises from the deep replacement of four of the solid angles of the

water until all the soluble parts are extracted; filter the decoction, and evaporate
to the consistence of an extract. Digest this extract in concentrated alcohol, then
pour off the alcohol and evaporate it; if sulphuric acid be then added to this extract,
it will take up the Cantharidin, which may be obtained in a tolerably pure
state by evaporation. The crystalline plates may be afterwards freed from the adhering

in this country, by the industry of our Entomologists; most, if not all, of which
possess vesicating powers. Of these the most common is the Lytta vittata, or potatoe
fly. The medicinal virtues of this insect were first discovered in 1797, and
found to be fully equal to those of the Spanish fly. Dr. Barton says “from frequent
employment of the two articles, I cannot hesitate to prefer the American to the
foreign fly. Long keeping, provided it be carefully kept, does not materially impair
the blistering property of the Lytta vittata. At the end of three or four years
after being collected, I have found it equal in power to the shop Cantharides.” By
the late Dr. Dana, Prof. of Chemistry in the College of Physicians and Surgeons
of New-York, the Lytta vittata was made the subject of analysis, and found to contain

<p class='c007'><a href='#r450'>450</a>. In cases of obstinate constipation of the bowels, charcoal is one of the most efficient
remedies in the whole Materia Medica. Many cases have yielded to it which
had resisted every other cathartic medicine previously used. Dr. Daniell, of Savannah,
to whom we are indebted for an interesting paper on this subject, states as
the result of his experience, “that the most speedy, as well as the most certain relief,
is to be obtained from the free use of Charcoal. If it does not wholly relieve, it always
very much mitigates the pain in six or eight hours from the period of its first administration;
and within my observation,” he adds, “the patient has always been
entirely composed before the operation of the medicine upon the bowels.” “In relation
to the dose of this medicine,” he states that “the rule which I have pursued
is to give it as freely and as frequently as the stomach will allow. The quantity required
is considerable. It has a happy influence in lulling the irritability of the stomach,
when nothing else which I have used, would control the nausea and vomiting
of the patient; thus fulfilling the double intention of first alleviating a very distressing
symptom, and then removing the disease itself. I usually give from one to three
table-spoonsful of Charcoal every half hour or hour: whenever the stomach becomes
overcharged with the medicine, the excess is thrown off, and the stomach is again
quiet. I give it in lime water, milk, or water alone—the vehicle having appeared to
me unimportant.” Philadel. Journal of Med. and Phys. Science, Vol. 5. p. 120. Ed.</p>

the College in their late Pharmacopœia; but, says Sir James Smith, as this name is
of a barbarous origin, (viz. from Elettaria, the Malabar name of the plant.) we
should greatly prefer that of Matonia; a suggestion which has been since adopted
by Mr. Roscoe of Liverpool, in his description of the Scitamineœ. The College

that the preparation sold under this empirical title, has no relation whatever to the
late discoveries of Pelletier. It is merely an extract prepared by macerating the
bruised substance of bark in cold water, and submitting the infusion to a very slow
evaporation.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f462'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r462'>462</a>. The designation of Cinchonin, consistent with the principles of chemical nomenclature,
must now have a termination in <em>a</em>, and the name Cinchonia appears preferable
to that of Cinchonina.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f463'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r463'>463</a>. The following is the process by which Cinchonia may be prepared. Take a
pound of Pale Bark, bruised small, and boil it for an hour in three pints of a very dilute
solution of pure Potass. After the liquid has cooled, it must be strained through
a fine cloth with pressure, and the residuum be repeatedly washed and pressed.
The cinchona, thus washed, is to be slightly heated in a sufficient quantity of water,
adding muriatic acid gradually until litmus paper is slightly reddened. When the
liquid is raised nearly to the boiling point, it is to be strained, and the cinchona again
pressed. To the strained liquor, while hot, add an ounce of sulphate of magnesia,
and after this add a solution of potass, till it ceases to occasion any precipitate.
When the liquor is cold, collect the precipitate on a filtre, wash and dry it, and dissolve
it in hot alcohol. On evaporation of the spirit, the cinchona will crystallize.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f464'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r464'>464</a>. Thus, as we have stated, 100 parts of Cinchonia unite with 13·021  of Sulphuric
acid, while the same weight of Quina requires for saturation not more than 10·91 of
the same acid.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f465'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r465'>465</a>. <span class='sc'>Sulphate of Quina.</span> As this preparation is considered the most active form of
the salifiable principle of bark, I have subjoined the most approved formula for its
preparation. Boil for half an hour two pounds of the appropriate bark in powder,
in sixteen pints of distilled water, acidulated with two fluid-ounces of sulphuric acid;
strain the decoction through a linen cloth, and submit the residue to a second ebullition
in a similar quantity of acidulated water; mix the decoctions, and add by
small portions at a time, powdered lime, constantly stirring it to facilitate its action
on the acid decoction. (Half a pound is near the quantity requisite.) When the
decoction has become slightly alkaline it assumes a dark brown colour, and deposits
a reddish brown flocculent precipitate, which is to be separated by passing it through
a linen cloth. The precipitate, is to be washed with a little cold distilled water
and dried. When dry it is to be digested in rectified spirit, with a moderate heat
for some hours; the liquid is then to be decanted, and fresh portions of spirit added
till it no longer acquires a bitter taste. Unite the spirituous tinctures, and distil in
a water-bath till three fourths of the spirit employed has distilled over. After this
operation there remains in the vessel a brown viscid substance covered by a bitter,
very alkaline and milky fluid. The two products are to be separated and treated
as follows. To the alkaline liquid add a sufficient quantity of sulphuric acid to
saturate it; reduce it by evaporation to half the quantity; add a small portion of
charcoal, and after some minutes ebullition, filter it whilst hot, and crystals of Sulphate
of Quina will form. The brown mass is to be boiled in a small quantity of
water, slightly acidulated with sulphuric acid, which will convert a large portion of
it into Sulphate of Quina. The crystals are to be dried by bibulous paper. Two
pounds of bark will, it is said, yield 5 to 6 drachms of the sulphate; of which eight
grains are considered equivalent to an ounce of bark. It has been prepared in this
country by several manufacturing chemists, especially by Mr. Pope of Oxford
Street, whose zeal and industry in Pharmaceutic experiments entitle him to great
commendation. The superior price of the bark, however, from the duty in this
country, as well as that of alcohol, must prevent us from entering into competition
with the French in its manufacture, and it has accordingly been found more œconomical
to import, than to prepare it.</p>

root of Cusparia, and in the berries of Capsicum, while in the bark of Cascarilla,
a substance bearing a much nearer relation in medicinal effect to the Bark, its presence
has not yet been discovered. It is said that experiments have been lately
made by M. M. Robiquet and Petroz on the Bark of the Carapa, which has been
successfully used in several parts of America in the cure of agues, and that they
have found in that bark a salifiable basis analogous to Quina.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f469'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r469'>469</a>. In Brande’s Journal for January 1830, it is announced that Serturner has discovered
other vegeto-alkalies in the Bark, besides the Cinchonia and Quinia.—One in
particular he has ascertained, which he calls <em>Chinioidia</em>, existing in combination
with a resinous sub-acid substance. This exists in the red and yellow bark with the
Cinchonia and Quinia. It has more alkaline power and capacity of saturation, as
well as greater medical power than any other vegeto-alkali in the Cinchona, but it
resembles them in its insolubility in water, its colour and taste. According to Serturner,
the febrifuge power of the <em>Chinioidia</em> is as superior to that of the Cinchonia
and Quinia as these are to the Bark.—In his hands it succeeded in many cases where
the Sulphate of Quinia had failed. <em>Ed.</em></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f471'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r471'>471</a>. Mr. Thompson has suggested the probability of this circumstance having arisen

<p class='c007'><a href='#r485'>485</a>. It may be here observed that Copper, in its metallic form, exerts no action on
the system. A most striking instance of this fact occurred during my hospital practice,
in the case of a young woman who swallowed six copper penny-pieces with a
view of destroying herself; she was attended by Dr. Maton and myself in the
Westminster Hospital for two years, for a disease which we considered visceral, but
which was evidently the effect of mechanical obstruction, occasioned by the coin.
After a lapse of five years she voided them, and then confessed the cause of her protracted
disease, during the whole course of which no symptom arose which could in
any way be attributed to the poisonous influence of copper. Dr. Baillie, in his
morbid anatomy, relates a case, in which five halfpence had been lodged in a pouch
in the stomach, for a considerable time, without occasioning any irritation; and
Theodore Gardelle, after his conviction for the murder of Mrs. King, in Leicester
Square, swallowed a number of halfpence, for the purpose of destroying himself,
but without producing any ill effects. Mr. A. T. Thomson relates also two cases of
halfpence being swallowed by children, in one of which the copper coin remained
six months in the intestines, and in the other two months. The filings of copper
were formerly a favorite remedy in rheumatism, a drachm of which has been taken
with impunity for a dose. It appears therefore that metallic copper does not undergo
any change in the digestive organs by which it is converted into a poison, notwithstanding
the presence of substances, which, out of the body, would at once
render it destructive, as we have too many cases to shew, from the careless use of
copper utensils in cookery. It is, however, a very important fact, that copper cannot
be dissolved while tin is co-existent in the mixture, hence the great use of tinning copper utensils; and farther, it is asserted that untinned coppers are less
liable to be injurious when pewter spoons are used for stirring, than when silver
ones are employed for that purpose; the explanation of this fact is to be sought for
in the well-known principle of Electro-Chemistry, and which has lately been applied
with so much ingenuity by the illustrious President of the Royal Society, for
the protection of copper on the bottom of ships, by the juxta-position of small discs
of Tin or Iron.<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c015'><sup>[486]</sup></a> For the same reason, M. Proust has shewn that the tinning of
kitchen utensils, which consists of equal parts of tin and lead, cannot be dangerous
from the presence of the latter metal, since it is sufficient that the lead should be
combined with tin, in order to prevent it from being dissolved in any vegetable acid.
M. Guersent therefore is wrong when, speaking of the tinning of copper vessels, he
says, “it is a light veil, which conceals the danger, instead of being a true preservative,
and that it only inspires a security often fatal.” Some recent experiments
however, of Dr. Bostock, have shewn that, in consequence of the volatility of
acetic acid, copper is not protected by the juxta-position of discs of tin; since the
acid under such circumstances ceases to form a part of the galvanic circle. The
poisonous effects of the <em>salts</em> of Copper have been strikingly illustrated during the
prosecution of Sir H. Davy’s experiments above alluded to, for it is found that
when the copper sheathing of ships is not protected by the contact of another metal,
they are uniformly free from marine animals, but that where the solution of the
copper is prevented by galvanic action, the bottoms soon become covered with
every species of sea insect.</p>

of the first sample, he found that out of ten grains, 5·5 were soluble in

prepared by the same process at Apothecaries’ Hall, 6 grs. were soluble. The residue,
insoluble in the spirit, was administered to a patient, and ascertained to be

<p class='c007'><a href='#r505'>505</a>. “I have the Cos Lettuce planted about eight inches asunder in rows, between
which there is sufficient space to enable persons to pass up and down without injuring
the plants. I commence my operations just before the plant is about to flower,
by cutting off an inch of the stem; the milky juice immediately exudes, and is collected
on pieces of Wove Cotton, about half a yard square. As soon as this becomes
charged, it is thrown from time to time into a vessel containing a small quantity
of water, which when sufficiently impregnated is evaporated at the common
temperature of the atmosphere, by exposure in a number of shallow dishes. The
<span class='sc'>Lactucarium</span>, in a few hours, is found adhering to the vessels in the form of an Extract,
but differing from every other in all its sensible properties: this method enables
me to collect <span class='sc'>Lactucarium</span> with great facility and dispatch, but it is still attended
with considerable expense, as the proportion of milky product is necessarily very
small, and the price of the medicine consequently high, and therefore not within
the reach of general practice. This consideration led me to make farther experiments,
for the purpose of ascertaining whether an <span class='sc'>Extract</span> might not be obtained
from the plant possessing all the properties of <span class='sc'>Lactucarium</span>, when administered in
large doses, and which could be introduced at a comparatively trifling cost. In
prosecuting this enquiry, I found that the plants contain most of the milky juice
when they have flowered and the leaves are beginning to assume a yellow hue, and
I observed that when cut down, the milky juice assumes for the most part a concrete
form, having subsided in the bark of the stalk and in the old leaves, a circumstance
which accounts for the extreme bitterness of these parts. I was naturally led from
these circumstances to choose the above period for my operations, and to select
those parts only of the plant for my extract, rejecting the substance of the stalk, and
the young sprouts. My method of procuring the extract is as follows. I first macerate
the parts in water, for twenty-four hours, and then boil them for two, after
which I allow the clear decoction to drain through a sieve, without using any pressure;
this is then evaporated, as far as it can be done with safety, and the process is
finished in shallow dishes, in the manner above described, for obtaining Lactucarium.
This extract, which I have called “<span class='sc'>Extractum Lactucæ Concentratum</span>,” is of
course less powerful than Lactucarium, but it possesses all the properties in larger
doses, and it has been found equally useful in a number and variety of cases, and is
not more than a sixth part of the price.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Probart has retired from trade, but I have just learnt that the same article is
now prepared, by a similar process, by Mr. Selway, Chemist, of New Cavendish
Street, and the specimens which I have received authorise me to recommend it for
trial. A concentrated tincture is also prepared.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Succus Spissatus Lactucæ sativæ,” of the shops, must of necessity be almost
inert, since it is commonly prepared at that period when the plant contains
none, or very little of the milky juice; and even if the Lettuce be employed at a
more mature season, it must still fail to afford an extract of any strength, as it is
merely the expressed juice, and that too of the whole plant indiscriminately, and
will be found to contain a very minute proportion of Lactucarium, the great bulk
being nothing more than inspissated green juice.</p>

is the <em>Prussiate of Iron</em>, or <em>Prussian Blue</em>. Like the other forms of iron it acts as a
powerful tonic, and as a remedy in intermitting and remitting fevers, Dr. Z. conceives
it to possess many advantages over Cinchona. These he states to be the following:
“1. It is void of taste, and may therefore be much more readily exhibited
than the Cinchona Officinalis, which to some is extremely unpleasant. 2. It may
be given in every stage of the disease, while the administration of bark is confined
to the apyrexiæ. 4. The dose is much smaller, being from four to six grains twice
or thrice in twenty-four hours; or at morning, noon and night; while bark, to be
effectual, must be given in much larger doses. 4. It never disagrees with the stomach,
or creates nausea, even in the most irritable state of this viscus; while bark
is not unfrequently rejected. 5. In its effects as a remedy calculated to prevent the
recurrence of future paroxysms, it is more certain, prompt, and effectual, than the
justly celebrated Cort. Peruvian. 6 and lastly, A patient treated with this article
will recover from the influence of intermitting and remitting fevers, in the generality
of cases, in much less time than is usual in those cases in which bark is employed.”
In using the Prussiate of Iron, Dr. Zollickhoffer directs that care should
be taken to select that which is of a very dark blue colour, approaching to a black,
having a shining coppery fracture, and adhering firmly to the tongue.</p>

or King’s Evil, Fistula, Scurvy, and all Impurities of the Blood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>My attention has been particularly directed to these pills, in consequence of having
lately seen, during the course of my professional duty, several highly respectable
persons, who had been induced to make trial of their efficacy. Their inventor, if I
am rightly informed, resides at Ipswich, where, for the benefit of suffering humanity,
he prepares these wonderful pills, and, with the alacrity of his patron deity, Mercury,
transmits them to every corner of the United Kingdom. It appears from the printed
directions which accompany the “Restorative Pills,” that their use must be continued
for a very long period; but upon this occasion we must allow the Doctor to speak
for himself. “It may be necessary to observe, that in some cases of Scrofula, especially
when the seat of the disease is in the feet, ancles, or hands, it may take a long
time to effect a cure, even two years, and it may be twelve or sixteen months, with
seeming little or no improvement, yet the cure is certain by perseverance.” What—two
years! and to be taken during a period of sixteen months without any sensible
benefit! Is it possible that persons can be found with sufficient credulity and resolution
to submit to so preposterous a proposal? we have no doubt that Mr. Chamberlain
can produce as great a portion of cures <em>after</em> such an ordeal, as was adduced in
former times, in proof of the efficacy of the Royal Touch, and for the same obvious
reason. (See page 16.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon examining these said pills, I find them to consist of Cinnabar, Sulphur, Sulphate
of Lime, and a little vegetable matter, perhaps gum. Each pill weighs a fraction
less than three grains; upon dividing one with a penknife, and examining the
cut surface through a lens, it exhibited the appearance of scoriæ of a brick red colour,
having small yellowish masses imbedded in its substance. When exposed on
a piece of platinum foil to the action of the blow-pipe, it yielded vapours of a strong
sulphureous smell, and left a residuum of a pearly white matter, which consisted almost
entirely of Sulphate of Lime. Upon submitting a portion of the pill, in a glass
tube, to the heat of a spirit lamp, two distinct sublimates were produced, the first
consisting of Sulphur, the second of Cinnabar; and a small carbonaceous deposit
remained. The Pill was then assayed, <em>via humida</em>; distilled water dissolved the
Sulphate of lime, which was identified by appropriate tests, and left sulphur and cinnabar
on the filtre. By the above experiments I feel warranted in considering the
composition of this pill as fully ascertained.</p>

is very essential that it should be quite free from red lead, or his preparations will in
a short time lose their splendour, and ultimately become black. This has unfortunately
happened with some preparations which Dr. Baillie presented to the College
of Physicians. Mr. Accum, in his work entitled “Death in the Pot,” states a case
of poisoning from cheese which had been coloured with adulterated Vermillion. I
am ready to admit, however, that the source of this information is of very doubtful
authority; never did a work appear which so little merited the attention it received;
even the title, which seemed to have some claim to originality, was borrowed from
a work by Mouchart, called “Mors in Olla.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r536'>536</a>. In many cases it is essential that the water should be at the boiling point, a few
degrees even less than this will often prove a source of failure; this is well exemplified
by the familiar fact of the weakness of our Tea, when made by water that does
not quite boil. The Monks of St. Bernard, in the Alps, complain that they cannot
make good Bouillie; the case is simply this, that from the altitude of their monastery,
the water boils before it can arrive at a sufficiently high temperature. Whence we
may deduce this important inference, that the solvent powers of water are affected
by a very slight range of temperature. See a fuller account of this subject in my
work on “Medical Chemistry.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r543'>543</a>. A formula for its preparation is introduced into the new <span class='sc'>Codex</span> of Paris, being
the one used by M. Pelletier; it is as follows. Let ℥i of the powder of Ipecacuan
be macerated in ℥ij of æther with a gentle heat for some hours, in a distilling apparatus;
let the portion which remains be triturated and boiled with ℥iv of alcohol;
it having been previously macerated in it; filter and let the remainder be treated
with fresh portions of alcohol, as long as any thing is taken up from the root; mix
these alcoholic solutions and evaporate to dryness; let this alcoholic extract be macerated
in cold distilled water, in order that every thing soluble in that menstruum
may be dissolved; filter, and evaporate to dryness; this extract is <em>Emetine</em>. In this
state however it contains a small quantity of gallic acid, but which is too inconsiderable
to affect its medicinal qualities.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f544'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r544'>544</a>. We agree with the author in his estimate of the value of <em>Emetine</em>. As a general
remedy, it possesses no advantage over the Ipecacuanha itself, and will probably
never supersede it. Cases may occur, however, in which its use will be desirable,
and it may then be given in the following doses. As an Emetic, from four to five
grains dissolved in a couple of ounces of some aromatic water; as a Diaphoretic,
about half a grain repeated every four hours; and as an Expectorant, one-fifth or one-fourth
of a grain repeated every two or three hours. These doses apply only to the
impure or coloured Emetine, the form in which it is commonly found. <em>Ed.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Phillips attempts to account for this apparent anomaly “from the effect which
heat sometimes produces of increasing instead of diminishing the attraction of cohesion.
In the present case, he continues, the affinities which are brought into play are,
the attractions of aggregation of the particles of the lime upon each other, the attraction
of the lime to form a hydrate with a small portion of the water, and the
mutual affinity existing between that hydrate and the water of solution.” And at
the high temperature he thinks that the former affinities may be so heightened as to
overpower the latter.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r554'>554</a>. Upon this fact Dr. Alton founded his ingenious process for preserving water from
putrefaction; in the first place he impregnated the water with lime, which from its
antiseptic property answered the purpose of keeping it most completely, and then, in
order to get rid of the lime, he merely added the carbonate of magnesia, which by
transferring its carbonic acid, rendered the lime insoluble, and consequently the water
tasteless and fit for economical purposes. Mr. Henry, however, proposed the
introduction of a current of carbonic acid into the cask, and this expedient has been
found equally effective, and far more economical.</p>

them, and it must be at all times a principal care to prevent a looseness, for if this
should happen it would carry off the medicines; under such circumstances the quantity
of the Decoction, since it is laxative, must be diminished, and other suitable
means must be taken by the advice of a Physician.” The credit of introducing alkaline
medicines for the cure of calculous disorders, does not however rest with
<span class='sc'>Mrs. Stephens</span>. It has been before stated in this work, that Basil Valentine employed
a fixed alkaline salt in such cases; and I may here add, that <span class='sc'>Sennertus</span>, in

a portion of the beans being grated was heated in a close vessel, under pressure,
with sulphuric æther, by which an oily matter was dissolved; the residuum then
yielded by the action of alcohol, a yellowish brown, very bitter substance, which
being boiled in pure magnesia and filtered, the colouring matter was washed out,
and the Strychnia and magnesia, in a state of mixture, remained on the filtre. The
Strychnia was then separated by alcohol, and thus obtained in a state of great purity.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r574'>574</a>. With regard to the use of Strychnia in paralysis, experiments sufficiently numerous
have now been made to enable us to judge of its true value and efficacy.
Like all other remedies it is by no means infallible. In some cases it does no good,
while in others it causes effects which no other remedy is capable of producing.
Every thing depends upon the nature of the case. Whenever paralysis is the result
of some organic derangement of the brain, such as tumors pressing upon the substance
of that organ, diseased alterations in its structure, or extravasations of fluid
which cannot be absorbed, then this remedy will be of no avail. On the other
hand, where the paralysis depends upon <em>simple diminished nervous excitement</em>,
it may and has been completely cured by the use of this article. In paraplegia it
has generally been found more successful than in hemiplegia. The first effects of
the remedy in all cases are convulsive twitchings of the paralyzed parts, and no benefit
is derived from its use until this effect is produced and continued for some time.
If plethora should be present, this is to be corrected by venesection, purgatives, and
other appropriate treatment. It is a great advantage attending the use of this powerful
agent that it does not at all impair the tone of the stomach; on the contrary,
it has a tendency to increase the appetite and promote digestion. In having recourse
to the Strychnia, the best way is to commence with small doses, increasing them
gradually according to the effect produced—one-eighth of a grain twice a day is sufficient
to begin with. This may be cautiously increased to 1/6, 1/4, or even ½ a grain
twice a day. Should any unpleasant symptoms occur, of course its use should be
discontinued; and when the symptoms subside, it may again be resumed. By
observing these general precautions there is no danger in using this otherwise potent
agent. The best form of giving it is in that of pill, made up with conserve of roses.</p>

<p class='c007'>From experiments made with <em>Brucia</em>, it is found to exert an influence analogous
to that of the <em>Strychnia</em>, only less energetic—one-fourth of a grain of the latter
equals in effect about six grains of the former. It occasions violent tetanic attacks,
and acts upon the nerves without affecting the brain or the intellectual functions.
From the inferior energy of the Brucia, it may be used in cases where the Strychnia
would not be proper. The dose to begin with is gr. j. twice a day, increased to
three or four times a day. Unless it does some good in five or six weeks its use
should be discontinued.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r585'>585</a>. In 1804 Seguin (Ann. de Chim. vol. 92) discovered another
crystalline body in opium, and although he described most of its properties he never hinted at its alkaline nature.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f586'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r586'>586</a>. Sertuerner at Eimbeck, in Hanover, had at the same
time as Derosne and Seguin, obtained these crystalline bodies, (Ann. de Chim. et
de Phy. T. v.) but it was not until the year 1817, that he first unequivocally proclaimed
the existence of a vegetable alkali, and assigned to it the narcotic powers
which distinguish the operation of opium; to this body he gave the name of Morphia,
and it appears to be the same as the essential salt noticed by Seguin. The
salt of Derosne, now more usually denominated Narcotine, is quite a different principle,
although it was constantly mistaken for one of the salts of Morphia, till M. Robiquet
(Ann. de Chim. &amp; de Phy. T. v.) pointed out its distinctive properties. It is
an azotized substance, crystallizing in beautiful pearly prisms or tables; soluble in
fixed oil, and still more so in æther and the acids; insoluble in water, and little soluble
in alcohol; destitute of action on the vegetable colours, and incapable of neutralizing
acids. There still exists, however, very considerable confusion with respect
to this salt, and farther experiments are required to ascertain its chemical nature,
as well as its physiological action.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f587'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r587'>587</a>. The discovery of an alkaline body in opium induced the French and German chemists
to examine the composition of other active vegetables, with a view to detect
the existence of an analogous principle; and their labours have been rewarded with
unexampled success. They have accordingly obtained <span class='sc'>Strychnia</span> from the nut of
the Strychnos nux vomica;—<span class='sc'>Brucia</span> from the bark of the Brucea Anti-dysenterica
(False Angustura Bark) <span class='sc'>Veratria</span> from the Veratrum album, V. Sabadilla and Colchicum
Autumnale;—<span class='sc'>Cinchonia</span> from the bark of the Cinchona Oblongifolia (Red
Bark);—<span class='sc'>Quina</span> (or Kina) from that of the Cinchona Cordifolia (Yellow Bark);—<span class='sc'>Emeta</span>
from the Callicocca Ipecacuanha;—<span class='sc'>Delphia</span>, from the Delphinium Staphisagria;—<span class='sc'>Picrotoxa</span>
from the Menispermum Cocculus;—<span class='sc'>Solana</span> from the Solanum
Nigrum, and S. Dulcamara; <span class='sc'>Gentia</span>, from Gentiana lutea;—<span class='sc'>Atropia</span> from the
Atropa Belladonna;—<span class='sc'>Hyoscyama</span>, from Hyoscyamus Niger. Besides which, Capsicum,
Piper nigrum, and <span class='sc'>Senna</span>, have been said to yield analogous principles of a
salifiable character. With respect to most of these alkaline bodies farther experiments
are required to establish our confidence; it is more than probable that several
of them will turn out to be disguised modifications of each other; it has already
been questioned whether <span class='sc'>Quina</span> and <span class='sc'>Cinchonia</span> be not varieties of one alkali; indeed
it is possible that all these bodies may have the same alkaline base, and that
they differ from each other in consequence of their combination with other principles,
derived from the vegetable in question, and impressing upon the salt its characteristic
virtues; and this idea receives material support from the fact, that they
are neutralized by a very small proportion of acid. (See a paper on this subject in
the 70th number of the Edinburgh Med. and Surg. Journ.)</p>

<p class='c007'>They have all many properties in common, such as a degree of bitterness varying
in intensity in different species; they are inodorous; are not altered by air or light,
but are decomposed by a moderate heat; most of them enter into fusion, but at different
temperatures, some for instance at below 212° Fahr. others not until they are
about to be decomposed; <span class='sc'>Hyoscyama</span> will even resist a low red heat. They are
very sparingly soluble in water, but they are in general rendered more so by the presence
of resinous matter. They are nearly all highly soluble in alcohol. Æther readily
dissolves <span class='sc'>Delphia</span>, <span class='sc'>Veratria</span>, <span class='sc'>Emeta</span>, <span class='sc'>Quina</span>, and <span class='sc'>Gentia</span>; but <span class='sc'>Morphia</span>, <span class='sc'>Cinchonia</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Picrotoxa</span>, are very sparingly soluble: and <span class='sc'>Strychnia</span> and <span class='sc'>Brucia</span> are
nearly insoluble in it; they combine with the acids; and, in general, form neutral
salts; but it appears that <span class='sc'>Veratria</span> and <span class='sc'>Emeta</span> always unite with an excess of acid.
All the combinations with the mineral acids, excepting the salts of <span class='sc'>Picrotoxa</span>, are
exceedingly soluble in water; and, with the exception of <span class='sc'>Nitrate of Cinchonia</span>,
and all the salts of <span class='sc'>Veratria</span>, they are crystallizable. The acetates too, with a few
exceptions, are also soluble, and they are disposed to form super-salts. All the oxalates,
except that of <span class='sc'>Picratoxa</span>, which is the most soluble of its salts, and all tartrates,
are rather insoluble, and have likewise a tendency to unite with an excess of
acid. The action of concentrated nitric acid on these alkaline bodies is very peculiar,
converting the greater number of them into artificial tannin; but it appears to
peroxidate <span class='sc'>Morphia</span>, <span class='sc'>Strychnia</span>, and <span class='sc'>Brucia</span>, rendering them less powerful as salifiable
bases, and diminishing or destroying their action on the animal body. See
Edinburgh Med. &amp; Surg. Journ. supra citat.</p>

<p class='c007'>By analysis, with the deutoxide of copper, these alkalies yield carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen; but no azote, unless they have been obtained by precipitation with
ammonia, as in the process of Sertuerner.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would appear that these bodies exist in their native plants, in combination with
peculiar acids; some of them are found in the state of Malates.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to their physiological action it may be stated, that they would appear
to concentrate in themselves the characteristic properties of the vegetables to
which they belong, and yet, although their effects are much greater than those of
the undecomposed vegetables, the same quantity of alkali is not so powerful in its
pure form, as in its natural state of combination. Thus one grain of morphia produces
no more effect than two grains of Turkey opium, which do not contain more
than a sixteenth part of the alkali. To explain this loss of efficacy which usually attends
our attempts at concentration, the reader is referred to the observations which
have been already offered upon this subject in the first part of this work, page 153.</p>

was probably opium; such was the opinion of Sprengel, expressed in his History
of Botany. Other authors have entertained a different belief. Delile, in his “Flora
Egyptiaca,” considers it to have been a preparation of hyoscyamus albus. Dr.
Christen, in his late elaborate Dissertation on Opium, agrees with Forbes, who states,
in his Oriental Memoirs, that in Hindostan Bendsch, i. e. nepenthe is prepared from
the cannabis sativa of Linnæus. Linder informs us that bangue is prepared from
the dried leaves of the wild cannabis, the smoke of which is said to be more narcotic
than even that of opium. There seems, however, to be good reason for supposing
that Indian bangue is a compound of several ingredients. Ray says that he

which has been long known and esteemed, as being more powerful in its operation
and less distressing in its effects than any tincture of opium, has until lately been involved
in much obscurity; the papers however of the late Edward Walton, of Sunderland,
one of the near relations of the original proprietor, having fallen into the
hands of Dr. Armstrong, that gentleman has obliged the profession by publishing the
manner in which it is prepared, and is as follows:—“Take half a pound of opium
sliced; three pints of good verjuice (juice of the wild crab,) and one and a half
ounce of nutmegs, and half an ounce of saffron. Boil them to a proper thickness,
then add a quarter of a pound of sugar, and two spoonsful of yeast. Set the whole
in a warm place near the fire, for six or eight weeks, then place it in the open air
until it becomes a syrup; lastly, decant, filter, and bottle it up, adding a little sugar
to each bottle.” One drop of this preparation is considered equal to about three of
the Tincture of Opium. P. L. It would appear that an Acetate of Morphia is
formed, which is more active, and less distressing in its effects, than any other narcotic
combination.</p>

<p class='c007'>The French Codex contains directions for preparing a compound very similar to
the Black Drop; viz.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vinum Opiatum Fermentatione Paratum</span></span>, or Guttæ seu Laudanum Abbatis
Rousseau. Take of white honey twelve ounces; warm water, three pounds; dissolve
the honey in the water, pour it into a matrass, and set it aside in a warm place:
as soon as fermentation has commenced, add four ounces of good opium, having
previously dissolved, or rather diffused it in twelve ounces of water; allow them to
ferment together for a month, then evaporate until ten ounces only remain, filter,
and add four ounces and a half of alcohol.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Liquor Opii Sedativus.</span> Under this name, Mr. Battley, a manufacturing druggist,
of Fore-street, London, has offered for sale a narcotic preparation, which it is
generally supposed owes its efficacy to the acetate of morphia; on being kept, however,
I found that it underwent some important change, during which so much air
was disengaged as to blow out the cork from the bottle with violence. This is an
objection to its admission into practice, unless we can ensure recently prepared portions
as often as they may be required.</p>

<p class='c007'>In publishing the above statement, I have unfortunately been the cause of much
unnecessary <span class='sc'>Ink-shed</span>. A letter, by Mr. Battley, has been industriously circulated
through the different ranks of the profession, purporting to be an apology for his
preparation, but after a careful perusal of it, instead of being able to discover any
argument in its favour, we receive a full acknowledgment of the validity of the objection
above stated. “I explained to Dr. Paris, that the liability of the solution to
undergo change, <span class='fss'>WAS A DEFECT</span> in the preparation, but that the addition of a little
spirit would prevent decomposition,” and yet in the next sentence he tells us that in
those cases in which it is most beneficial, “the addition of spirit would be highly improper.”
See Medical Repository, vol. xiii, p. 273.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the circumstance which has excited the greatest indignation in the mind of
Mr. Battley, is my having applied the term <span class='fss'>NOSTRUM</span> to his preparation. Every medicine
that is prepared by a secret process, and sold for the private advantage of an
individual, is properly designated a NOSTRUM. And I am at a loss to discover any
feature in the present case that can entitle it to be considered as an exception to this
general rule; but perhaps Mr. Battley is inclined to be hypercritical, and as the preparation
is not indebted to him, but to Wedelius or Le Mort, for its origin, is prepared
to exclaim with the Roman Poet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Quæ non fecimus ipsi vix ea <span class='fss'>NOSTRA VOCO</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Battley also complains bitterly of my having inserted his preparation under
so odious a motto as “Arcana Revelata fætent,” for my own part I cannot conceive
any thing more appropriate to the case, viz. Arcana, <em>these secret preparations</em>, revelata,
<em>exposed to the air</em>, fætent, <em>grow fœtid</em>. But, notwithstanding the objections which
I have thus felt it my duty to offer, I am disposed to speak favourably of its mild and
uniform effects, and in justice to Mr. Battley, I will further state the same opinion has
been formed by a great number of respectable practitioners. The late Mr. Haden,
who during his protracted illness took a large quantity of this preparation, states, in
his Translation of the Formulary of Dr. Majendie, that it is devoid of exciting, and
almost of constipating, properties. He made a very good substitute, “by macerating
the dregs, remaining after making tincture of opium, in a solution of Tartaric
acid.” The preparation formed a tolerably deep tincture, and 40 drops acted, he
thought, in all respects, like 20 of the liquor opii sedativus. It neither stimulated,
nor produced costiveness.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r595'>595</a>. <span class='sc'>Godbold’s Vegetable Balsam.</span> In the specification of the Patent for this
nostrum forty-two different vegetables are directed to be distilled “for the purpose
of extracting their essences, which are to be preserved separately and apart from
each other, in syrups, and are to be mixed with the following gums and drugs, viz.
Gum Dragon, Gum Guaiacum, Gum Arabic, and Gum Canada, these being dissolved
in double distilled vinegar, with a quantity of Storax dissolved in Spirits of Wine
and Oil of Cinnamon. It is to be bottled off, and kept three years before it is fit to
be administered for the <span class='sc'>Cure</span> of Consumption, or any Asthmatic Complaint.” It is
hardly necessary to observe, that no such directions ever are, or indeed ever could
be followed; in short the “<span class='sc'>Balsam</span>” is little else than simple oxymel. It is, however,
not a little curious that amongst the forty-two plants enumerated, there should
be several that would on distillation yield Prussic acid, such as the Bays. We wonder
that this accidental circumstance has not been noticed, and turned to account,
by some of those worthy disciples of Esculapius who live by the credulity of mankind,

from them by expression, do not possess any of the narcotic properties of the
plant, and that they were even baked into cakes and used as an article of food by
the ancients, yet has there been in later times very considerable contention respecting
the propriety and safety of using such oil. The cultivation of the Poppy for the
sake of the oil of its seeds, as an article of food, has been long carried on in France,
Brabant, and Germany; and more recently in Holland. At about the beginning of
the 17th century, the opposition to this use of the Poppy manifested itself in France,
and became so violent, that the Lieutenant General of the Police of Paris ordered
the medical faculty of that city to make the strictest examination concerning this
point, and they accordingly reported that, as there is nothing narcotic or prejudicial
to health in the oil, the use of it might be permitted. But this decision was unsatisfactory;
and popular clamour determined the Court to pass a decree in 1718, prohibiting
the sale of Poppy Oil, whether mixed or unmixed! The sale of the article,
however, notwithstanding this most singular decree, was clandestinely encouraged,
and it gradually increased until the year 1735, when the Court issued a severe decree,
enjoining the superintendent to mix a certain quantity of the extract of Turpentine,
with every cask containing 1100 lbs. of this oil, of which no less than 2000 casks were
consumed in Paris alone. But the secret demand for it increased until 1773, when
a Society of Agriculture undertook to examine the question, and the result of their
labours had the effect of reversing the prohibition, and of convincing the multitude
that their fears were entirely unfounded, and that there was really no narcotic power,
nor any secret mischief in the article.</p>

of antimony is nearly or totally inert, it appears to me, that if proof could be
obtained, that the oxide of antimony is in this state, the deficiency of power in the
Pulvis Antimonialis would be accounted for.” He then proceeds to detail his experiments, from which he deduces the composition of this preparation to be as follows:</p>

the curing of several kinds of fish; this will not appear strange, says Mr. Parkes,
when it is considered that merely its own weight of water is all that is necessary for
the complete solution of muriate of magnesia; a circumstance which renders it impossible
to preserve such salt for any length of time in a dry state. This muriate
however might be separated from common salt, on a large scale, for one shilling per
cwt. By exposing the salt to a gentle heat in reverberatory furnaces, the muriatic
acid of the magnesian muriate will fly off, and the magnesia (on a subsequent solution
of the salt) will be precipitated. It is well known that muriate of magnesia begins
to part with its acid at a temperature a little higher than that of boiling water.</p>

one which has been just communicated to me by my friend Mr. John Taylor,
the agent of the London Company for working the Real del Monte Silver Mines in
Mexico. He states that the ore, which consists of the Sulphuret of Silver, is, together
with Mercury, amassed in heaps with iron pyrites and common salt; and that
such is the greediness of the Mules employed in the works for the Salt, that they are
constantly licking the materials; the consequence is that a portion of the Silver
Amalgam is introduced into their stomachs; the animals, however, suffer no inconvenience;
but, after death, on opening their stomachs, it is not unusual to find considerable
masses of Silver, the mercury having escaped, or been dissolved by the
gastric juice.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r644'>644</a>. I have myself witnessed the bad effects of a diet of unsalted fish; and in my examination
before a Committee of the House of Commons in 1818, appointed “for
the purpose of inquiring into the laws respecting the Salt Duties,” I stated the great
injury which the poorer classes in many districts sustained in their health, from an
inability to procure this essential article. Lord Somerville (in his address to the
Board of Agriculture) gave an interesting account of the effects of a punishment
which formerly existed in Holland. “The ancient laws of the country ordained
men to be kept on bread alone, <span class='fss'>UNMIXED WITH SALT</span>, as the <span class='fss'>SEVEREST</span> punishment
that could be inflicted upon them in their moist climate; the effect was horrible:
these wretched criminals are said to have been <span class='fss'>DEVOURED BY WORMS</span>, engendered in
their own stomachs.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Salt</span> was an object of taxation at a very early period in this country; Ancus Martius,
640 years before our era ‘<em>Salinarum Vectigal</em> instituit.’ This tribute was continued
on the Britons when our Isle was possessed by the Romans, who worked the
Droitwich Mines, and who made salt part of their soldiers <em>Salarium</em>, or salary.
Hence the custom at the Eton Montem of asking for salt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great advantages which must ultimately accrue to this nation in its fisheries,
agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, from a late remission of the odious and
impolitic tax upon salt, are incalculable. The government of France appears to have
been as impolitic with regard to this tax as the English. Buonaparte abolished the
collection of turnpike dues; and imposed a tax on salt, payable at the Salt-pans, in
its stead. It is not perhaps generally known, that by the aid of this tax he was enabled
to complete the grand entrance into Italy, over the Simplon; so that it may
be fairly observed, that if <span class='sc'>Hannibal</span> was enabled to cross the Alps by the aid of
<span class='sc'>Vinegar—Buonaparte</span>, by the assistance of <span class='sc'>Salt</span>, succeeded in constructing a
public road over the same mountains.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f645'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r645'>645</a>. <span class='sc'>Cheltenham Salts.</span>—A factitious compound has been long vended, as a popular
purgative, under this name; it is formed by triturating together the following
salts. Sulphate of Soda, grs. 120. Sulphate of Magnesia, grs. 66. Muriate of Soda,
10. Sulphate of Iron, gr. ½. As a purgative it is very efficacious, and superior
probably to that which is actually obtained by the evaporation of the Cheltenham
water itself; for notwithstanding the high pretensions with which this latter salt has
been publicly announced, it will be found to be little else than common Glauber’s
Salt. This fact has been confirmed by the experiments of Mr. Richard Phillips,
(Annals of Philosophy, No. lxi,) who observes, that the “<span class='sc'>real Cheltenham Salts</span>
contain no chalybeate property, but are merely sulphate of soda, mixed with a
minute quantity of soda, and a very small portion of common salt.” It could not be
imagined that the salt should contain oxide of iron even in a state of mixture, much
less in combination, for carbonate of iron is readily decomposed by ebullition, and
the oxide of iron is precipitated before the salt can be crystallized. A preparation,
under the name of Thomson’s Cheltenham Salts, is accordingly manufactured in
London, by evaporating a solution consisting of sulphate of soda and sub-carbonate
of soda.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Efflorescence of real Cheltenham Salts.</span>” The preceding salt deprived of
its water of crystallization.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Efflorescence of real Magnesian Cheltenham Salts</span>,” <span class='sc'>made from the
Waters of the Chalybeate Magnesian Spa.</span> This is asserted to be a sub-sulphate
from nature, which combines both a pure and a sub-sulphated magnesia in its composition;
“but,” says Mr. Phillips, “neither nature nor art has ever produced such
a combination; in truth, it consists of Epsom Salt, with small portions of magnesia,
and muriate of magnesia or muriate of soda.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Murio-sulphate of Magnesia and Iron.</span> The preparation thus named by Mr.
Thomson, was found by Mr. Phillips to consist of Epsom Salt, deprived of part of
its water of crystallization, and discoloured by a little rust of iron, and containing a
small portion of muriate of magnesia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it appears, that not one of these preparations is similar to the water which is
drank at the Spa; in order to remedy this difficulty, Mr. Thomson prepared the
“<span class='sc'>Original Combined Cheltenham Salts</span>,” by evaporating the waters to dryness:
but a very small share of chemical penetration is required to satisfy us that no process
of this description can remedy the defect described, for as Mr. Phillips has observed,
the chalybeate properties of the water must be essentially altered by such an
operation.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r647'>647</a>. I apprehend that the peculiar flavour of Cogniac depends upon the presence of
an æthereal spirit, formed by the action of Tartaric or perhaps Acetic acid upon Alcohol;
it is on this account that Nitric Æther, when added to Malt spirits, gives
them the flavour of French Brandy. The same flavour is also successfully obtained
by distilling British spirits over wine lees, or by distilling a spirit obtained from Raisin
Wine, which has become acescent.</p>

<p class='c007'>In new brandy there also appears to be an uncombined acid, giving to it a peculiar
taste and quality, which are lost by age. This explains the reason why the addition
of five or six drops of “liquor ammoniæ,” to each bottle of new brandy, will
impart to it the qualities of that of the oldest date.</p>

when this nostrum was first introduced amongst us, that they could not prepare
it with our own spirits, but were obliged to be at the expense of true French
Brandy. Our own Spirits, although equally coloured, would never produce a violet
tincture; at length, however, the mystery was discovered, and the gall nut imparted
to the tincture that characteristic colour which was so long considered essential to
its efficacy; but the discovery threw discredit upon the nostrum, and it fell into disuse.</p>

to a state of powder, without its becoming oxidized, M. Renault had recourse to
its alloys for deciding the question; and he found that Mispickel (an alloy of iron
and arsenic,) when given to the extent of two drachms, had no apparent effect; this
result agrees with the conclusion of Bayen in his work on Tin, and proves that the
arsenic which may be contained in that metal cannot produce any medicinal effect,
as it exists in its metallic state. Recherches Chimiques sur l’Etain, par Bayen et

Principle has been given, will not, however diluted, undergo any kind of fermentation;
for it is the presence of this peculiar extractive matter, the natural leaven of
fruits, that enables it to undergo that process; since, however, all clayed sugars, or
modifications of sugar which are short of perfect purity, still contain a small proportion
of this extractive, they are capable of fermenting, when sufficiently dilute; Dr.
Maccullough, in his essay on the art of making wine, observes, that by the addition
of a very small quantity of the Sulphite of Potass, the fermentation of syrups and
preserves may be effectually prevented; he states also, that the same object may generally

<p class='c007'>In the first place, the learned commentator Dr. Grey, observes that the word here

or transcriber, for henebon, i. e. henbane. Now it appears from Gerarde, that “tabaco”
was commonly called henbane of Peru, (hyoscyamus Peruvianus,) and when
we consider how high the public prejudice ran against this herb in the reign of
James, it seems very likely that Shakespeare should have selected it, as an agent of
extraordinary malignity. No preparation of the hyoscyamus, with which we are
acquainted, would produce death by application to the ear, whereas the essential oil
of Tobacco would, without doubt, occasion a fatal issue. The term distilment has
also called forth a remark from Steevens, which is calculated to support this conjecture;
surely, says he, this expression signifies, that the preparation was the result of
a distillation.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r692'>692</a>. The following remarks, with which I have lately been favoured by Dr. Davy,
appear interesting. “In the few cases which I have tried this remedy for the retention
of urine, I have seen no good effects produced, until it excited nausea. For
this purpose I have found it advantageous to give it in a little tepid water: upon
chemical examination I could not discover that it ever passed off by the urine; the
fæces, however, are uniformly coloured black by it, whence I conclude it must be
evacuated through the bowels. In order to prevent its tendency to constipate the
bowels, I have found it necessary to give some aperient, as castor oil, speedily after
its exhibition.” May not this latter circumstance explain the reason of his not having
detected it in the urine? (See p. 95.)</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r696'>696</a>. In the first edition of this work, I stated the probability of the Veratrum being
the active ingredient of the <span class='sc'>Eau Medicinale</span>, and, upon the authority of Mr. James
Moore, I inserted a formula for its preparation; subsequent enquiry, however, has
shewn the fallacy of this opinion; but the fact of the medicinal efficacy of the Veratrum,
when combined with opium, in the cure of gout, remains incontrovertible.
One of the two Sweating Powders of <span class='sc'>Ward</span> was a combination of the Veratrum and
Opium, it is certainly a very singular coincidence, that recent experiments should
have shewn that the active principle of colchicum is identical with that which gives
efficacy to the hellebore, viz. Gallate of Veratria. The fact itself offers a striking
instance of medical experience having anticipated the discoveries of chemistry,
while it affords a powerful case in support of the arguments which I have urged in
the first part of this work, p. 55.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now as the poet was born in the Consulate of Manlius, as above stated, which happened
A. U. C. 688, and Bibulus was Consul in 694, the wine must have been hoarded
from the time Horace was six years of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wine however might, according to the opinion of our Poet, be too old; he terms
wine of this description “Languidiora Vina,” and Plautus compares old wine which

<div class='footnote' id='f706'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r706'>706</a>. The Sack of Shakespeare was probably Sherry; a conjecture which receives
additional strength from the following passage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Falstaff.—“You rogue, here’s <em>lime</em> in this Sack too: There is nothing but roguery
to be found in villainous man: yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime
in it; a villainous coward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Huldrick Van Speagle, in his “Famous Historie of most Drinks”, says “Sack is no
hippocrite, for any man who knows what an Anagram is will confesse that it is contained
within the litteral letters and limmits of its own name, which is to say. <span class='sc'>Cask</span>,
i. e. Sack.” See Taylor’s Translation of the “Work of the painful and industrious

<div class='footnote' id='f707'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r707'>707</a>. Expose equal parts of sulphur and powdered oyster shells to a white heat for
fifteen minutes, and when cold, add an equal quantity of cream of tartar; these are
to be put into a strong bottle with common water to boil for an hour; and the solution
is afterwards to be decanted into ounce phials, adding 20 drops of muriatic acid
to each. This liquor will precipitate the least quantity of lead from wines in a very
sensible black precipitate. As iron might be accidentally contained in the wine, the
muriatic acid is added to prevent its precipitation.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r708'>708</a>. Lead will not only correct the acidity of wines, but remove the rancidity of oils:

<p class='c007'><a href='#r712'>712</a>. Laudanum. Paracelsus first bestowed the term Laudanum upon a preparation of
Opium, a <span class='sc'>Laudata</span> ejus efficacia, <span class='sc'>Laudatum</span> medicamentum.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f713'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r713'>713</a>. According to the experiments of M. Vogel, Annales de Chimie, (t. lxiv. p. 220)
this ointment is nothing more than metallic mercury mixed with grease, the division
of which has been carried to such an extent as to impart a blackish colour to the
mixture.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f714'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r714'>714</a>. It is to be hoped that a quantity of the ointment will be prepared according to
these views, and be submitted to a more extended series of experiments. The oxide
may be procured by decomposing Calomel by a solution of pure potass, or by pouring
a solution of the nitrate of mercury into a caustic alkaline solution; this oxide
should be at first triturated with a little lard, in the cold, to make the penetration
complete, taking care that the lard be quite free from common salt, or else Calomel
will be the ultimate result: the mixture is then to be submitted to the action of heat,
and it is very important to attend to the necessary temperature, for at 212° the oxide
and lard will not unite, at 600° the oxide will be decomposed and the mercury volatilized,
at 500° and 400° the oxide is partially decomposed, some red oxide being
formed and mercury reduced; the proper temperature is between 300° and 320°, at
which it should be maintained for an hour, and the ointment should be stirred until
cold.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f715'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r715'>715</a>. Four ounces, troy, of mercurial ointment, prepared six months before, were
kept at 212°, when it separated into two distinct strata, viz. the upper one which
was light grey, and extremely active as a medicine, and the under one, which upon
being triturated with magnesia, yielded a large proportion of metallic mercury, and
which was not found to possess any activity.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f716'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r716'>716</a>. Whenever it is our object to direct the mercurial impression to any particular
organ, we should if possible rouse its excitability by some specific stimulus. An exception,
however, to this doctrine would seem to offer itself in the fact, that children
at the period of dentition are not readily salivated; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</span></i>, we should have certainly
supposed that a predisposition to a flux of saliva would have produced a contrary
effect. As it is, we can only conclude that those organs are not disposed to take on
any action that may be incompatible with, or adverse to, that of dentition.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f717'>

and coloured with Alkanet root.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indians use an ointment in inveterate itch, which is said to prove very successful,
and consists of finely powdered Cocculus Indicus mixed with a little warm
Castor oil.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f719'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r719'>719</a>. I have been lately informed by a practical chemist, that he has occasionally
found his hydrogen, when produced by zinc and dilute acid, to contain a portion of
Arsenuretted hydrogen; a fact which confirms the assertion of Roloff.</p>

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
